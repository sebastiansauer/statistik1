	abstract = {This article explains the foundational concepts of Bayesian data analysis using virtually no mathematical notation. Bayesian ideas already match your intuitions from everyday reasoning and from traditional data analysis. Simple examples of Bayesian data analysis are presented, that illustrate how the information delivered by a Bayesian analysis can be directly interpreted.
Bayesian approaches to null-value assessment are discussed. The article clarifies misconceptions about Bayesian methods that newcomers might have acquired elsewhere. We discuss prior distributions and explain how they are not a liability but an important asset. We discuss
the relation of Bayesian data analysis to Bayesian models of mind, and we briefly discuss what methodological problems Bayesian data analysis is not meant to solve. After you have read this article, you should have a clear sense of how Bayesian data analysis works and the sort of information it delivers, and why that information is so intuitive and useful for drawing conclusions from data.},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type {II} errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12765},
	abstract = {Experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas of cognitive science are increasingly being analyzed using Bayesian methods. This has been facilitated by the development of probabilistic programming languages such as Stan, and easily accessible front-end packages such as brms. The utility of Bayesian methods, however, ultimately depends on the relevance of the Bayesian model, in particular whether or not it accurately captures the structure of the data and the data analyst's domain expertise. Even with powerful software, the analyst is responsible for verifying the utility of their model. To demonstrate this point, we introduce a principled Bayesian workflow (Betancourt, 2018) to cognitive science. Using a concrete working example, we describe basic questions one should ask about the model: prior predictive checks, computational faithfulness, model sensitivity, and posterior predictive checks. The running example for demonstrating the workflow is data on reading times with a linguistic manipulation of object versus subject relative clause sentences. This principled Bayesian workflow also demonstrates how to use domain knowledge to inform prior distributions. It provides guidelines and checks for valid data analysis, avoiding overfitting complex models to noise, and capturing relevant data structure in a probabilistic model. Given the increasing use of Bayesian methods, we aim to discuss how these methods can be properly employed to obtain robust answers to scientific questions.

	abstract = {Every philosophy has holes, and it is the responsibility of proponents of a philosophy to point out these problems. Here are a few holes in Bayesian data analysis: (1) the usual rules of conditional probability fail in the quantum realm, (2) flat or weak priors lead to terrible inferences about things we care about, (3) subjective priors are incoherent, (4) Bayesian decision picks the wrong model, (5) Bayes factors fail in the presence of flat or weak priors, (6) for Cantorian reasons we need to check our models, but this destroys the coherence of Bayesian inference. Some of the problems of Bayesian statistics arise from people trying to do things they shouldn't be trying to do, but other holes are not so easily patched. In particular, it may be a good idea to avoid flat, weak, or conventional priors, but such advice, if followed, would go against the vast majority of Bayesian practice and requires us to confront the fundamental incoherence of Bayesian inference. This does not mean that we think Bayesian inference is a bad idea, but it does mean that there is a tension between Bayesian logic and Bayesian workflow which we believe can only be resolved by considering Bayesian logic as a tool, a way of revealing inevitable misfits and incoherences in our model assumptions, rather than as an end in itself.},

	abstract = {Enhancing vaccine uptake is a critical public health challenge1. Overcoming vaccine hesitancy2,3 and failure to follow through on vaccination intentions3 requires effective communication strategies3,4. Here we present two sequential randomized controlled trials to test the effect of behavioural interventions on the uptake of {COVID}-19 vaccines. We designed text-based reminders that make vaccination salient and easy, and delivered them to participants drawn from a healthcare system one day (first randomized controlled trial) (n = 93,354 participants; clinicaltrials number {NCT}04800965) and eight days (second randomized controlled trial) (n = 67,092 individuals; clinicaltrials number {NCT}04801524) after they received a notification of vaccine eligibility. The first reminder boosted appointment and vaccination rates within the healthcare system by 6.07 (84\%) and 3.57 (26\%) percentage points, respectively; the second reminder increased those outcomes by 1.65 and 1.06 percentage points, respectively. The first reminder had a greater effect when it was designed to make participants feel ownership of the vaccine dose. However, we found no evidence that combining the first reminder with a video-based information intervention designed to address vaccine hesitancy heightened its effect. We performed online studies (n = 3,181 participants) to examine vaccination intentions, which revealed patterns that diverged from those of the first randomized controlled trial; this underscores the importance of pilot-testing interventions in the field. Our findings inform the design of behavioural nudges for promoting health decisions5, and highlight the value of making vaccination easy and inducing feelings of ownership over vaccines.},

	abstract = {Students’ beliefs that success in science depends on exceptional talent negatively impact their motivation to learn. For example, such beliefs have been shown to be a major factor steering students away from taking science and math courses in high school and college. In the present study, we tested a novel story-based instruction that models how scientists achieve through failures and struggles. We designed this instruction to challenge this belief, thereby improving science learning in classroom settings. A demographically diverse group of 402 9th and 10th grade students read 1 of 3 types of stories about eminent scientists that described how the scientists (a) struggled intellectually (e.g., made mistakes in investigating scientific problems, and overcame the mistakes through effort), (b) struggled in their personal life (e.g., suffered family poverty and lack of parental support but overcame it), or (c) made great discoveries (a control condition, similar to the instructional material that appears in many science textbooks, that did not describe any struggles). Results showed that participation in either of the struggle story conditions improved science learning postintervention, relative to that of students in the control condition. Additionally, the effect of our intervention was more pronounced for low-performing students. Moreover, far more students in either of the struggle story conditions felt connected to the stories and scientists than did students in the control condition. The use of struggle stories provides a promising and implementable instructional approach that can improve student motivation and academic performance in science and perhaps other subjects as well.

In a large and diverse cross-cultural sample (N = 10,195 from 24 countries), we presented participants with obscure, meaningless statements attributed to either a spiritual guru or a scientist. We found a robust global source credibility effect for scientific authorities, which we dub ‘the Einstein effect’: across all 24 countries and all levels of religiosity, scientists held greater authority than spiritual gurus. In addition, individual religiosity predicted a weaker relative preference for the statement from the scientist compared with the spiritual guru, and was more strongly associated with credibility judgements for the guru than the scientist. Independent data on explicit trust ratings across 143 countries mirrored our experimental findings. These findings suggest that irrespective of one’s religious worldview, across cultures science is a powerful and universal heuristic that signals the reliability of information.},

Dr. Snow saved countless lives when he traced the source of the cholera outbreak to a specific water pump through inductive reasoning, which he communicated through maps and spatial evidence. His methods have since inspired several fields of scientific inquiry. Informed by the extant research on {RTM}, we speculated that it could have helped test Dr. Snow’s hypothesis about cholera and empirically identified the sole source of contaminated well water. We learned that it could and, although it was not available to Dr. Snow in the 1800s, we discuss {RTM}’s implications for present-day research and practice as it relates to the analysis, prevention and treatment of cholera and other public health threats around the world.},

	doi = {10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181adcf6a},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many of the nearly 30 million Americans suffering with migraine headaches are not helped by standard therapies, a proportion of which can harbor undesirable side effects. The present study demonstrates the efficacy of independent surgical deactivation of three common migraine headache trigger sites through a double-blind, sham surgery, controlled clinical trial.
{METHODS}: Seventy-five patients with moderate to severe migraine headache who met International Classification of Headache Disorders {II} criteria were studied. Trigger sites were identified (frontal, temporal, and occipital), and patients were randomly assigned to receive either actual or sham surgery in their predominant trigger site. Patients completed the Migraine Disability Assessment, Migraine-Specific Quality of Life, and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey health questionnaires before treatment and at 1-year follow-up.
{RESULTS}: Of the total group of 75 patients, 15 of 26 in the sham surgery group (57.7 percent) and 41 of 49 in the actual surgery group (83.7 percent) experienced at least 50 percent reduction in migraine headache (p {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, 28 of 49 patients in the actual surgery group (57.1 percent) reported complete elimination of migraine headache, compared with only one of 26 patients in the sham surgery group (3.8 percent) (p {\textless} 0.001). Compared with the control group, the actual surgery group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all validated migraine headache measurements at 1 year. These improvements were not dependent on the trigger site. The most common surgical complication was slight hollowing of the temple in the group with temporal migraine headache.
{CONCLUSION}: This study confirms that surgical deactivation of peripheral migraine headache trigger sites is an effective alternative treatment for patients who suffer from frequent moderate to severe migraine headaches that are difficult to manage with standard protocols.},

Because mindfulness meditation encourages judgment-free thoughts and feelings, we predicted that participants in the mindfulness condition would be especially likely to form false memories. In two experiments, participants were randomly assigned to either a mindfulness induction, in which they were instructed to focus attention on their breathing, or a mind-wandering induction, in which they were instructed to think about whatever came to mind. The overall number of words from the Deese-Roediger-{McDermott} paradigm that were correctly recalled did not differ between conditions. However, participants in the mindfulness condition were significantly more likely to report critical nonstudied items than participants in the control condition. In a third experiment, which tested recognition and used a reality-monitoring paradigm, participants had reduced reality-monitoring accuracy after completing the mindfulness induction. These results demonstrate a potential unintended consequence of mindfulness meditation in which memories become less reliable.},

	abstract = {A state of mindfulness is characterized by focused, nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment. The current research experimentally investigated how state mindfulness influences task motivation and performance, using multiple meditation inductions, comparison conditions, tasks, and participant samples. Mindfulness inductions, relative to comparison conditions, reduced motivation to tackle mundane tasks (Experiments 1–4) and pleasant tasks (Experiment 2). Decreased future focus and decreased arousal serially mediated the demotivating effect of mindfulness (Experiments 3 and 4). In contrast to changes in motivation, inducing a state of mindfulness did not affect task performance, as seen in all experiments but one (Experiments 2–5). Meta-analyses of performance experiments, including unreported findings (i.e., the file drawer), supported these conclusions. Experiment 5’s serial mediation showed that mindfulness enabled people to detach from stressors, which improved task focus. When combined with mindfulness’s demotivating effects, these results help explain why mindfulness does not alter performance.},

The results showed that mindfulness meditation exercises increased sensitivity to time and lengthened perceived time. However, this temporal improvement with meditation exercises was primarily observed in the experienced meditators. Our results also showed the experienced meditators were less anxious than the novice participants, and that the sensitivity to time increased when the level of anxiety decreased. Our results were explained by the practice of mindfulness technique that had developed individuals’ abilities in devoting more attention resources to temporal information processing.},

However, to date, the data regarding the impact of mindfulness on memory—and specifically on memory distortions—is scarce and incomplete. The present study was aimed to examine whether mindfulness practice would have an effect on true and false memories. To this end, the effect of mindfulness meditation practice on memory performance was examined in two experiments in which false memories were provoked using the Deese-Roediger-{McDermott} ({DRM}) paradigm (Roediger \& {McDermott}, 1995). In Experiment 1, college students were randomly divided into either a 5-week mindfulness-practice group (n = 29) or a waitlist control group (n = 22). In Experiment 2, college students were randomly divided into either a brief mindfulness session (n = 21) or a mind-wandering control group (n = 19). The results indicated that mindfulness increased the recognition of true memories with no effect on spontaneous false-memories, yet increased the rate of provoked false-memories. These findings are discussed in terms of memory sensitivity and response bias, and it is argued that mindfulness may have a lesser effect on encoding processes than previously suggested.},

Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret {CIs}. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students—all in the field of psychology—were asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a {CI}. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of {CIs}. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers’ performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a {CI}. The misunderstandings surrounding p-values and {CIs} are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.},

The same percentage (96\%) applies for full-text articles.

Over 25 years (1990–2015), use of P values in abstracts has doubled for all {PubMed}, and tripled for meta-analyses, while for some types of designs such as randomized trials the majority of abstracts report P values. There is major selective reporting for P values. Abstracts tend to highlight most favorable P values and inferences use even further spin to reach exaggerated, unreliable conclusions. The availability of large-scale data on P values from many papers has allowed the development and applications of methods that try to detect and model selection biases, for example, p-hacking, that cause patterns of excess significance. Inferences need to be cautious as they depend on the assumptions made by these models and can be affected by the presence of other biases (e.g., confounding in observational studies). While much of the unreliability of past and present research is driven by small, underpowered studies, {NHST} with P values may be also particularly problematic in the era of overpowered big data. {NHST} and P values are optimal only in a minority of current research. Using a more stringent threshold, as in the recently proposed shift from P {\textless} 0.05 to P {\textless} 0.005, is a temporizing measure to contain the flood and death-by-significance. {NHST} and P values may be replaced in many fields by other, more fit-for-purpose, inferential methods. However, curtailing selection biases requires additional measures, beyond changes in inferential methods, and in particular reproducible research practices.},

Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09104},
	abstract = {Learning about cause and effect is arguably the main goal in applied econometrics. In practice, the validity of these causal inferences is contingent on a number of critical assumptions regarding the type of data that has been collected and the substantive knowledge that is available. For instance, unobserved confounding factors threaten the internal validity of estimates, data availability is often limited to non-random, selection-biased samples, causal effects need to be learned from surrogate experiments with imperfect compliance, and causal knowledge has to be extrapolated across structurally heterogeneous populations. A powerful causal inference framework is required to tackle these challenges, which plague most data analysis to varying degrees. Building on the structural approach to causality introduced by Haavelmo (1943) and the graph-theoretic framework proposed by Pearl (1995), the artificial intelligence ({AI}) literature has developed a wide array of techniques for causal learning that allow to leverage information from various imperfect, heterogeneous, and biased data sources (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016). In this paper, we discuss recent advances in this literature that have the potential to contribute to econometric methodology along three dimensions. First, they provide a unified and comprehensive framework for causal inference, in which the aforementioned problems can be addressed in full generality. Second, due to their origin in {AI}, they come together with sound, efficient, and complete algorithmic criteria for automatization of the corresponding identification task. And third, because of the nonparametric description of structural models that graph-theoretic approaches build on, they combine the strengths of both structural econometrics as well as the potential outcomes framework, and thus offer an effective middle ground between these two literature streams.},

A case study is conducted for predictive maintenance of wind farms, where endoscopic images were used for bearing fault detection. The experiment consisted of 54 technical inspectors and 2301 images collected over 138 wind turbines, and each inspector was shown images and asked to identify bearing faults in the absence and presence of {AI}-assistance. The results showed that {AI}-assistance had a statistically significant impact on improving the technical inspector’s specificity and time efficiency. The level of improvement was dependent on the level of expertise, where the generalist group showed greater improvements in specificity and time efficiency (24.6\% and 25.3\%, respectively) when compared with the specialist group (4.7\% and 6.4\%, respectively).

	abstract = {Internet of Things ({IoT}) and Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) play a vital role in the upcoming years to improve the assistance systems. The {IoT} devices utilize several sensor devices that able to collect a large volume of data in different domains which is processed by {AI} techniques to make the decision about the assistance problems. Among several applications, in this work, {IoT} with {AI} is used to examine the healthcare sectors to improve patient assistance and patient care in the future direction. Traditional health care assistance system fails to predict the exact patient health information and needs which reduces the accuracy of patient assistance process. For these issues, an {IoT} sensor with {AI} is used to predict the exact patient details such as fitness tracker, medical reports, health activity, body mass, temperature, and other health care information which helps to choose the right assistance process. Healthcare mobile application is used to achieve this goal and collect the patient’s information. This information is shared in the cloud environment, which is accessed and processed by applying the optimized machine learning techniques. The gathered patient details are processed according to the iterative golden section optimized deep belief neural network ({IGDBN}). The introduced network examines the patient’s details from the previous health information which helps to predict the exact patient health condition in the future direction. The efficiency of {IoT} sensor with an {AI}-based health assistance prediction process is developed using {MATLAB} tool. Excellence is determined in terms of precision (99.87), loss error (0.045), simple matching coefficient (99.71\%), Matthews correlation coefficient (99.10\%) and accuracy (99.86\%).},

              Objective
              Except in broad outline, little is known about the most likely symptomatic trajectories in prodromal schizophrenia. The aim of this study is to delineate these pathways.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Taking into account existing clinical knowledge, the causal relationships between the 12 prodrome scales of the
                Schizotypic Syndrome Questionnaire
                ({SSQ}) were examined in a general-population sample by applying the mathematical theory of directed graphs. Use was made of two discovery algorithms implemented in the Tetrad-4 program, as well as of the graphical {DAGitty} program to test whether a particular model holds.
              
            
            
              Results
              A promising model was selected that may describe the causal pathways in schizophrenic prodromal unfolding. Testing this model by means of {DAGitty}, it was shown that the minimal testable implications, listed as conditional independences, and the direct and total effects in the model, identified after correction for bias, were as hypothesized. For practical reasons, a simpler version of the resulting {SSQ} model, containing only its principal pathways, was provided.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Although resembling an earlier model that was based on a series of {LISREL} analyses, the present model was believed to provide a more dependable description of schizophrenic prodromal unfolding, as it relies on methods that are less subject to the limitations involved in {SEM}.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This paper aims to examine the effects of subjective and financial literacy, big five personality traits and emotions (fear, anger, hope and sadness) on risk aversion, risky investment intention and investment choices were investigated. Interactions of these three variables (risk aversion, risky investment intention and investment choices) were also examined.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              
                For this purpose, in January-February 2019, collected data on 446 subjects from Turkey using the internet (341) and face-to-face (105) survey instruments. The authors exploited {IBM} {SPSS} Statistics for analysis. {ANOVA},
                t
                -test and discriminant analysis were performed.
              
            
            
              Findings
              As a result of the analyzes, two personality traits (neuroticism and openness) and two emotions (fear and sadness) were determined as predictors of risk aversion. For risky investment intention, risk aversion, two personality traits (neuroticism and openness) and one of the same and other one different two emotions (fear and anger) were found.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Investment choices can be estimated by objective financial literature, risk aversion and risky investment intention. In addition, individuals’ risk averse or risk taking characteristics differ according to their level of sadness with agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism personality traits. Similarly, have a risky investment intention or have not risky investment intention also differs according to sadness emotions with conscientiousness and openness. Finally, the choice of stocks or bank deposits varies according to subjective financial literacy and extraversion personality trait.},

Eines der am weitesten verbreiteten Verfahren zur Erfassung von Impulsivität ist die Barratt Impulsiveness Scale ({BIS}-11; Patton, Stanford \& Barratt, 1995 ). Es wurde gezeigt, dass die drei Faktoren nicht-planende, motorische und aufmerksamkeitsbasierte Impulsivität auch ausreichend gut mit einer verkürzten Form der {BIS}-11 erfasst werden können ({BIS}-15; Spinella, 2007 ). Die vorliegende Arbeit stellt diese Kurzversion der {BIS}-11 in einer deutschen Übersetzung vor. Reliabilität und Faktorstruktur des Fragebogens wurden in einer Stichprobe (N = 752) von überwiegend Studierenden getestet. Die dreifaktorielle Struktur von Spinella (2007) konnte bestätigt werden. Die interne Konsistenz war gut (Cronbachs α = .81). In einer zweiten Studie (N = 51) zeigte sich konvergente Validität durch Zusammenhänge mit einem anderen Impulsivitätsmaß ({UPPS}). Die {BIS}-15 empfiehlt sich durch ihre guten psychometrischen Kennwerte und ihre ökonomische Durchführbarkeit für die Erfassung von Impulsivität im deutschen Sprachraum.},

There has been widespread and growing use of this approach within medical settings in the last 20 years, and many claims have been made regarding its efficacy. This article will provide a critical evaluation of the available state of knowledge regarding {MBSR} and suggestions for future research.: A review of the current literature available within the medical and social sciences was undertaken to provide an evaluation regarding what we know about the construct of mindfulness, the effectiveness of {MBSR}, and mechanisms of action.: There has been a paucity of research and what has been published has been rife with methodological problems. At present, we know very little about the effectiveness of this approach. However, there is some evidence that suggests that it may hold some promise.: The available evidence does not support a strong endorsement of this approach at present. However, serious investigation is warranted and strongly recommended.},

	abstract = {Obwohl Messungen zur Arbeitszufriedenheit und -motivation gerne als interne Angelegenheit durchgeführt werden und die Messwerte auch häufigintern bleiben, können veröffentlichte Untersuchungen stellvertretend Aussagen zu Einstellungen zur Organisation, Arbeit und Arbeitsumfeld aufzeigen. Gutknecht (2005/06) befragte zwischen 2003 und 2005 knapp 400 Arbeitnehmende aus der {IT}-Branche und dem Berufsmilitär bezüglich ihrer organisationsspezifi schen Einstellungen. Seine Ergebnisse beziehen sich besonders auf die Wahrnehmung von belastenden zwischenmenschlichen Beziehungen in der Organisation. Gutknecht geht davon aus, dass diese Wahrnehmung sich indirekt negativ auf die Einstellung der Organisation gegenüber auswirkt. Nachfolgend sind jene Ergebnisse dargestellt, die besonders deutlich hervorgetreten sind: * Das »Commitment« hat sich in allen Stichproben als der beste Prädiktor hinsichtlich der Kündigungsabsichten herausstellt. Als besonders relevant zur Vorhersage des »Commitments« bezeichnet Gutknecht die Kontextfaktoren: »Während die Zufriedenheit mit den Kollegen, mit der Arbeitsplatzsicherheit und in geringerem Ausmaß mit der Höhe des Lohns verhältnismäßig groß ist, werden die Facetten Lohngerechtigkeit, Zukunftsaussichten und der Führungsstil in der Organisation weniger gut beurteilt«. * Der Führungsstil ist durchweg kritisch beurteilt worden -- sowohl auf Stufe der Organisation wie auch in Bezug zu Chef-Mitarbeiter- Beziehungen. Dabei zeigt sich, dass die Beziehung zwischen Arbeitnehmenden und Vorgesetzten bedeutsam sein kann: »Unabhängig von Rang, Alter oder auch Arbeitszeit sind Personen, die von einer guten Beziehung zum Vorgesetzten berichten, allgemein zufriedener, resignieren weniger und generieren auch in unsicheren Zeiten weniger Kündigungsabsichten. Zudem beurteilen sie das intrinsische Motivationspotenzial wie auch die Kontextfaktoren vorteilhafter, selbst wenn in vielen Fällen diese Aspekte vom direkten Vorgesetzten kaum aktiv beeinfl usst werden dürften«. * Die Frage, ob »der direkte Vorgesetzte die Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten des Unterstellten erkennt«, verneinen viele der Befragten in beiden Stichproben. Darüber hinaus werden aber auch mangelnde Unterstützung, fehlender Respekt und mangelnde Fairness als Mangel in der Beziehung zum Vorgesetzten mitgeteilt.},

In boosting, successive trees give extra weight to points incorrectly predicted by earlier predictors. In the end, a weighted vote is taken for prediction.

Thus, ambiguity--lacking information about another--leads to liking, whereas familiarity--acquiring more information--can breed contempt. This "less is more" effect is due to the cascading nature of dissimilarity: Once evidence of dissimilarity is encountered, subsequent information is more likely to be interpreted as further evidence of dissimilarity, leading to decreased liking. The authors document the negative relationship between knowledge and liking in laboratory studies and with pre- and postdate data from online daters, while showing the mediating role of dissimilarity.},

Pupil responses were recorded in real-time before, during, and after light exposure. Maximal contraction amplitude and sustained contraction amplitude were calculated. In addition, we quantified the summed pupil response during continuous light stimulation as the total area between a reference line representing baseline pupil size and the line representing actual pupil size over 20 s (area under the curve). There was no significant difference in the repeated measure compared to the first test for any of the pupil response parameters. In conclusion, we have developed a novel prototype of color pupillometer which demonstrates good repeatability in evoking and recording the pupillary response to a bright blue and red light stimulus.},

For example, the data in Table 1 and Figure 1 represent the time evolution of an algal sample taken in the Adriatic Sea and do seem to follow a logistic curve.

Such a fundamental change of human habits is likely to have generalized consequences for other basic fine motor skills as well. In this article, the authors provide evidence that the skill to produce precisely controlled arm-hand movements is related to the usage of computer keyboards in producing written text in everyday life. This result supports the notion that specific cultural skills such as handwriting and typing shape more general perceptual and motor skills.

But does this additional information increase measurement accuracy and precision? Eight guidelines are suggested to aid the analyst in optimizing the manner in which rating scales categories cooperate in order to improve the utility of the resultant measures. Though these guidelines are presented within the context of Rasch analysis, they reflect aspects of rating scale functioning which impact all methods of analysis. The guidelines feature rating-scale-based data such as category frequency, ordering, rating-to-measure inferential coherence, and the quality of the scale from measurement and statistical perspectives. The manner in which the guidelines prompt recategorization or reconceptualization of the rating scale is indicated. Utilization of the guidelines is illustrated through their application to two published data sets.},

Meditation state dynamics were measured with spectral decomposition of the last 6 min of the eyes-closed silent meditation compared to control state. Meditation was associated with a decrease in frontal delta (1-4 Hz) power, especially pronounced in those participants not reporting drowsiness during meditation. Relative increase in frontal theta (4-8 Hz) power was observed during meditation, as well as significantly increased parieto-occipital gamma (35-45 Hz) power, but no other state effects were found for the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), or beta (12-25 Hz) bands. Alpha power was sensitive to condition order, and more experienced meditators exhibited no tendency toward enhanced alpha during meditation relative to the control task. All participants tended to exhibit decreased alpha in association with reported drowsiness. Cross-experimental session occipital gamma power was the greatest in meditators with a daily practice of 10+ years, and the meditation-related gamma power increase was similarly the strongest in such advanced practitioners. The findings suggest that long-term Vipassana meditation contributes to increased occipital gamma power related to long-term meditational expertise and enhanced sensory awareness.},

A more comprehensive understanding of how these relationships influence the care experience should include an investigation of the association between employee job satisfaction and family perception of the quality of care. This cross-sectional study investigated the association at a regional hospice. Using the Kendall's tau correlation, employee satisfaction scores for care teams trended toward a positive correlation with family overall satisfaction scores from the Family Evaluation of Hospice Care (tau=0.47, P=0.10). A trend for differences in employee satisfaction between the care teams to associate with differences in overall family perceptions of the quality of care also was found using the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (chi(2)(K-W)=9.236, P=0.075). Post hoc tests indicated that overall family perceptions of quality of care differed between the hospice's Residence Team and Non-Hospice Facilities Team. Finally, positive associations between employee satisfaction and the families' Intent to recommend hospice (tau=0.55, P=0.059) and Inform and communicate about patient (tau=0.55, P=0.059) were noted. Selected employee and family comments provide complementarity to further clarify or explain the respondent data. These results suggest that employee satisfaction is associated with family perceptions of the quality of hospice care. Opportunities for improving both employee job satisfaction and family perceptions of the quality of care are discussed.},

	abstract = {The information processing capacity of the human mind is limited, as is evidenced by the so-called "attentional-blink" deficit: When two targets (T1 and T2) embedded in a rapid stream of events are presented in close temporal proximity, the second target is often not seen. This deficit is believed to result from competition between the two targets for limited attentional resources. Here we show, using performance in an attentional-blink task and scalp-recorded brain potentials, that meditation, or mental training, affects the distribution of limited brain resources. Three months of intensive mental training resulted in a smaller attentional blink and reduced brain-resource allocation to the first target, as reflected by a smaller T1-elicited P3b, a brain-potential index of resource allocation. Furthermore, those individuals that showed the largest decrease in brain-resource allocation to T1 generally showed the greatest reduction in attentional-blink size. These observations provide novel support for the view that the ability to accurately identify T2 depends upon the efficient deployment of resources to T1. The results also demonstrate that mental training can result in increased control over the distribution of limited brain resources. Our study supports the idea that plasticity in brain and mental function exists throughout life and illustrates the usefulness of systematic mental training in the study of the human mind.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Mindfulness is a process whereby one is aware and receptive to present moment experiences. Although mindfulness-enhancing interventions reduce pathological mental and physical health symptoms across a wide variety of conditions and diseases, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. Converging evidence from the mindfulness and neuroscience literature suggests that labeling affect may be one mechanism for these effects.

{METHODS}: Participants (n = 27) indicated trait levels of mindfulness and then completed an affect labeling task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The labeling task consisted of matching facial expressions to appropriate affect words (affect labeling) or to gender-appropriate names (gender labeling control task).

{RESULTS}: After controlling for multiple individual difference measures, dispositional mindfulness was associated with greater widespread prefrontal cortical activation, and reduced bilateral amygdala activity during affect labeling, compared with the gender labeling control task. Further, strong negative associations were found between areas of prefrontal cortex and right amygdala responses in participants high in mindfulness but not in participants low in mindfulness.

{CONCLUSIONS}: The present findings with a dispositional measure of mindfulness suggest one potential neurocognitive mechanism for understanding how mindfulness meditation interventions reduce negative affect and improve health outcomes, showing that mindfulness is associated with enhanced prefrontal cortical regulation of affect through labeling of negative affective stimuli.},

The stimuli consisted of a frequent standard tone (500 Hz), an infrequent oddball tone (1000 Hz), and an infrequent distracter (white noise), with all stimuli passively presented through headphones and no task imposed. The strongest meditation compared to control state effects occurred for the distracter stimuli: N1 amplitude from the distracter was reduced frontally during meditation; P2 amplitude from both the distracter and oddball stimuli were somewhat reduced during meditation; P3a amplitude from the distracter was reduced during meditation. The meditation-induced reduction in P3a amplitude was strongest in participants reporting more hours of daily meditation practice and was not evident in participants reporting drowsiness during their experimental meditative session. The findings suggest that meditation state can decrease the amplitude of neurophysiologic processes that subserve attentional engagement elicited by unexpected and distracting stimuli. Consistent with the aim of Vipassana meditation to reduce cognitive and emotional reactivity, the state effect of reduced P3a amplitude to distracting stimuli reflects decreased automated reactivity and evaluative processing of task irrelevant attention-demanding stimuli.},

This approach is rooted in philosophical realism and an attitude toward data analysis centered around causality and common sense.

Expertise and experience did not reduce this effect.

	abstract = {One of the most salient features of emotion is the pronounced variability among individuals in their reactions to emotional incentives and in their dispositional mood. Collectively, these individual differences have been described as affective style. Recent research has begun to dissect the constituents of affective style. The search for these components is guided by the neural systems that instantiate emotion and emotion regulation. In this article, this body of research and theory is applied specifically to positive affect and well-being. The central substrates and peripheral biological correlates of well-being are described. A resilient affective style is associated with high levels of left prefrontal activation, effective modulation of activation in the amygdala and fast recovery in response to negative and stressful events. In peripheral biology, these central patterns are associated with lower levels of basal cortisol and with higher levels of antibody titres to influenza vaccine. The article concludes with a consideration of whether these patterns of central and peripheral biology can be modified by training and shifted toward a more salubrious direction.},

There were 174 females and 89 males, aged between 16 and 89 years (mean = 53.5, sd = 13.9). The average number of years of schooling was 6.3 (sd = 4.1). Main outcome measure. A reliable and valid patient satisfaction scale.: Factor analysis was conducted on the patient satisfaction scale and two factors, accounting for 71.6\% of the variance, were extracted. The major items on Factor I were support, consideration, friendliness, and encouragement, labelled the interpersonal dimension. Factor {II} emphasized availability of a seat and toilet in the waiting area and cleanliness, labelled the organizational dimension. The two factors had very good reliability coefficients: 0.85 (organizational) and 0.98 (interpersonal). Multi-trait scaling showed that all items exceeded the item convergent (r {\textgreater} 0.40) and discriminant (Z {\textgreater} 1.96) validity criteria. Patients in poor general health were significantly less satisfied (P = 0.007) with the organizational quality of their care than patients in good health; patients in poor mental health were significantly less satisfied (P = 0.04) with the interpersonal quality of their care than patients in good mental health.: The findings provided support for Donabedian's model. They demonstrated that attributes of providers and settings are major components of patient satisfaction, and showed that the scale is a reliable and valid measure of patient satisfaction for this South African population.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to assess whether seventh-grade students use of information and communication technology ({ICT}) was related to performance on working memory tasks. In addition, the study tested whether the relationship between {ICT} use and performance on working memory tasks interacted with seventh-grade students' socioeconomic level and gender. 275 students recruited from 30 Chilean schools were grouped according to their self-reported use of {PC}, the Internet, Chat and Video games. To assess students' working memory performance, they were tested with a digit span test and a visuo-spatial measure. Only one of our two dependent variables reflected a relationship between specific profiles of {ICT} use and working memory. Higher scores on the digits span test were related to those user profiles combining {PC} use and video game play, that is, those identified as Full users and as {PC} and Console Gamers. We did not find an interaction effect of gender and {ICT} use or an interaction effect of socioeconomic level and {ICT} use. There are three possible explanations for these results: first, a proclivity of students with higher working memory capacity to engage in technology use; second, an impact on working memory of potential differences in multitasking; and, third, an impact on working memory of video game play. However, these results must be interpreted cautiously since scores on the {GEFT}, our visuo-spatial working memory measure, were not related to any profile of technology use. As serious educational games become more regularly used at school, previous differences in video game experience become growingly important. Future research must study whether the intended benefits of serious educational games are being mediated by individual differences in previous exposure to video games and other information and computer technologies, with independence of the directionality of the relationship between video game play and working memory. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Twelve subjects (ten male, two female) slept a total of 107 nights in the sleep laboratory. Standard recordings were taken of electroencephalographic ({EEG}), electrooculographic ({EOG}), and electromyographic ({EMG}) activity. Suppressions of {EMG} were observed in all subjects during all stages of non-{REM} sleep, but occurred with the greatest frequency during stages 2 and 4. The suppressions averaged 250 msec in duration and exhibited a higher frequency in the 10 min immediately prior to {REM} periods than in the 10 min immediately subsequent to {REM} periods. The relationship between the H reflex and phasic {EMG} suppressions was examined in three subjects (two males, one female) who were recorded a total of 9 nights. In addition to standard {EEG}, {EOG}, and {EMG} derivations, the H reflex was elicited by electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve, recorded from the soleus muscle, and viewed on an oscilloscope. The {EEG}, {EMG}, and soleus muscle action potentials were recorded on magnetic tape. In all subjects it was found that whenever a stimulus occurred coincidental with a phasic {EMG} reduction, the reflex response was invariably inhibited. The observation and verification of phasic activity during non-{REM} sleep in the human subject is related to recent data in the cat, and the application of this physiological event to studies of non-{REM} mentation is discussed.},

Precision can overwhelm us with information, whereas insight connects seemingly disparate pieces of information into a simple picture. Unlike computers, humans depend on insight. Based on the author's fifteen years of teaching at {MIT}, Cambridge University, and Olin College, The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering shows us how to build insight and find understanding, giving readers tools to help them solve any problem in science and engineering. To master complexity, we can organize it or discard it. The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering first teaches the tools for organizing complexity, then distinguishes the two paths for discarding complexity: with and without loss of information. Questions and problems throughout the text help readers master and apply these groups of tools. Armed with this three-part toolchest, and without complicated mathematics, readers can estimate the flight range of birds and planes and the strength of chemical bonds, understand the physics of pianos and xylophones, and explain why skies are blue and sunsets are red.

Using voxel-based morphometry, this study investigated {MRI} brain images of 20 mindfulness (Vipassana) meditators (mean practice 8.6 years; 2 h daily) and compared the regional gray matter concentration to that of non-meditators matched for sex, age, education and handedness. Meditators were predicted to show greater gray matter concentration in regions that are typically activated during meditation. Results confirmed greater gray matter concentration for meditators in the right anterior insula, which is involved in interoceptive awareness. This group difference presumably reflects the training of bodily awareness during mindfulness meditation. Furthermore, meditators had greater gray matter concentration in the left inferior temporal gyrus and right hippocampus. Both regions have previously been found to be involved in meditation. The mean value of gray matter concentration in the left inferior temporal gyrus was predictable by the amount of meditation training, corroborating the assumption of a causal impact of meditation training on gray matter concentration in this region. Results suggest that meditation practice is associated with structural differences in regions that are typically activated during meditation and in regions that are relevant for the task of meditation.},

	abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ({DLBCL}), the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, is curable in less than 50\% of patients. Prognostic models based on pre-treatment characteristics, such as the International Prognostic Index ({IPI}), are currently used to predict outcome in {DLBCL}. However, clinical outcome models identify neither the molecular basis of clinical heterogeneity, nor specific therapeutic targets. We analyzed the expression of 6,817 genes in diagnostic tumor specimens from {DLBCL} patients who received cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone ({CHOP})-based chemotherapy, and applied a supervised learning prediction method to identify cured versus fatal or refractory disease. The algorithm classified two categories of patients with very different five-year overall survival rates (70\% versus 12\%). The model also effectively delineated patients within specific {IPI} risk categories who were likely to be cured or to die of their disease. Genes implicated in {DLBCL} outcome included some that regulate responses to B-cell-receptor signaling, critical serine/threonine phosphorylation pathways and apoptosis. Our data indicate that supervised learning classification techniques can predict outcome in {DLBCL} and identify rational targets for intervention.},

The generality of this framework is demonstrated through tests of 16 different axioms, including transitivity, monotonicity, segregation, additivity of joint receipt, dominance, coalescing, restricted branch independence, double, triple cancellation, and the Thomsen condition. The model many previously proposed methods of axiom testing under error, is analytically tractable, and provides a Bayesian for the random relation approach to probabilistic measurement(J. Math.

This study set out to assess, 4 years later, the influence of race and socioeconomic status ({SES}) on perceived quality of care from health care providers. {DESIGN}: A 1998 countrywide survey of 3820 households assessed many aspects of health care delivery, including levels of satisfaction with health care providers among different segments of South African society. {RESULTS}: Fifty-one percent (n = 1953) of the respondents had attended a primary care facility in the year preceding the interview and were retained in the analysis. Both race and {SES} were significant predictors of levels of satisfaction with the services of the health care provider, after adjusting for gender, age, and type of facility visited. White and high {SES} respondents were about 1.5 times more likely to report excellent service compared with Black and low {SES} respondents, respectively. {CONCLUSION}: In South Africa, race and {SES} are not synonymous and can no longer be considered reliable proxy indicators of one another. Each has distinct and significant but different degrees of association with client satisfaction. Any assessment of equity-driven health policy in South Africa should consider the impacts of both race and {SES} on client satisfaction as one of the indicators of success.},

There is however little discussion of the implications of this for nurse educators. This article reviews the nursing and counselling literature related to empathy. We begin with an exploration of different perspectives of empathy; from its behavioural and measurable characteristics to its less tangible, intuitive qualities. By drawing upon both policy and research, it is clear that patients want empathic and emotionally competent nurses. Nurse educators therefore have a responsibility to provide an education that engenders empathic understanding. We explore the implications of these findings for nurse education, identifying key areas for consideration in the preparation of emotionally skilled, empathic student nurses.},

Fisher, randomization “relieves the experimenter from the anxiety of considering innumerable causes by which the data may be disturbed.” Since, in particular, it is said to control for known and unknown nuisance factors that may considerably challenge the validity of a result, it has become very popular. This contribution challenges the received view. First, looking for quantitative support, we study a number of straightforward, mathematically simple models. They all demonstrate that the optimism surrounding randomization is questionable: In small to medium-sized samples, random allocation of units to treatments typically yields a considerable imbalance between the groups, i.e., confounding due to randomization is the rule rather than the exception. In the second part of this contribution, the reasoning is extended to a number of traditional arguments in favour of randomization. This discussion is rather non-technical, and sometimes touches on the rather fundamental Frequentist/Bayesian debate. However, the result of this analysis turns out to be quite similar: While the contribution of randomization remains doubtful, comparability contributes much to a compelling conclusion. Summing up, classical experimentation based on sound background theory and the systematic construction of exchangeable groups seems to be advisable.},

We compared the accuracies of {RF} and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, {USA}, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, {USA}, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, {USA}. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing {RF} to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that {RF} identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate how situational interest develops over time and how it is related to academic achievement in an active-learning classroom. Five measures of situational interest were administered at critical points in time to 69 polytechnic students during a one-day, problem-based learning session. Results revealed that situational interest significantly increased after the problem stimulus was presented. Subsequently, situational interest gradually decreased but at the end of the day increased again. Testing a path model relating the situational interest measures showed strong (directional) interrelations. Moreover, situational interest was highly predictive for observed achievement-related classroom behaviors. The latter, in turn, proved to be a significant predictor of academic achievement. Aggregating situational interest over the day led to less accurate predictions of achievement-related classroom behaviors and academic achievement. Implications of these findings for situational interest research are discussed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) strengthens synapses that are activated immediately before a postsynaptic spike, and weakens those that are activated after a spike. To prevent an uncontrolled growth of the synaptic strengths, weakening must dominate strengthening for uncorrelated spike times. However, this weight-normalization property would preclude Hebbian potentiation when the pre- and postsynaptic neurons are strongly active without specific spike-time correlations. We show that nonlinear {STDP} as inherent in the data of Markram et al. (1997) Science 275:213-215 can preserve the benefits of both weight normalization and Hebbian plasticity, and hence can account for learning based on spike-time correlations and on mean firing rates. As examples we consider the moving-threshold property of the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rule, the development of direction-selective simple cells by changing short-term synaptic depression, and the joint adaptation of axonal and dendritic delays. Without threshold nonlinearity at low frequencies, the development of direction selectivity does not stabilize in a natural stimulation environment. Without synaptic unreliability there is no causal development of axonal and dendritic delays},

	abstract = {Beruf und Arbeit sind zentrale Faktoren unseres Lebens und haben großen Einfluss auf die Gestaltung des Alltags, indem sie ihn maßgeblich strukturieren und bestimmen. In der arbeitspsychologischen Forschung beschäftigt man sich seit langem mit der Bedeutung der Arbeit für den Menschen, ihren Wirkungen und Folgen. Die Frage, inwiefern sich eine ungesunde und risikoreiche Arbeitsumgebung negativ auf die Gesundheit auswirken kann, ist aber schon eine viel ältere und wurde insbesondere im Zuge der industriellen Revolution des 19. Jahrhunderts und ihren Folgen für das Arbeitsleben der Menschen aufgeworfen. Lag in den 60er und 70er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts der Fokus gesundheitsbezogener Überlegungen am Arbeitsplatz noch auf der Prävention von Unfällen und der Reduktion physischer Belastungen, zeigte sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten ein Wandel hin zur Betonung von arbeitsbedingten psychischen Belastungen und Erkrankungen (Buunk, de Jonge, Ybema \& de Wolff, 1998). Arbeitsplatzunsicherheit, stetig zunehmende Anforderungen sowie steigender Zeit- und Leistungsdruck bestimmen den heutigen Arbeitsalltag und fordern von vielen Arbeitnehmern ihren Tribut, So geht seit den 70er Jahren der Krankenstand, also die Dauer der krankheitsbedingten Abwesenheit vom Arbeitsplatz, in Deutschland zwar stetig zurück (Busch, 2006). Gleichzeitig steigt aber der Anteil an psychischen Erkrankungen als Ursache für Arbeitsunfähigkeit stetig an. Im Vergleich zum Jahr 2000 stieg der durch psychische Erkrankungen verursachte relative Anteil der Arbeitsunfähigkeitstage um 20\% und lag im Jahr 2006 an vierter Stelle der Ursachen für Arbeitsunfähigkeit (Lademann, Mertesacker \& Gebhardt, 2006), Dennoch werden trotz objektiv gleicher Arbeitsbelastungen nicht alle Menschen auf gleiche Weise beeinträchtigt.},

In several studies, community residents reported on problem occurrence and affect several times a day or at the end of the day. We found reliable evidence that persons who scored high (vs. low) in Neuroticism reported more daily problems, tended to react with more severe emotions, experienced more mood spillover from prior occasions, and exhibited stronger reactions to recurring problems (the "neurotic cascade"). The susceptibility of neurotics to stress seems to extend to all types of problems while certain other dimensions of personality (e.g., Agreeableness) are associated with hyperreactivity to particular kinds of problems. The research demonstrates how daily process research can provide insight about classic problems in the field of individual differences.},

Campbell, the fundamental measurement of extensive quantities is described by an axiomatization for the comparision of effects of (or responses to) arbitrary combinations of “quantities” of a single specified kind. For example, the effect of placing one arbitrary combination of masses on a pan of a beam balance is compared with another arbitrary combination on the other pan. Measurement on a ratio scale follows from such axioms. In this paper, the essential character of simultaneous conjoint measurement is described by an axiomatization for the comparision of effects of (or responses to) pairs formed from two specified kinds of “quantities”. The axioms apply when, for example, the effect of a pair consisting of one mass and one difference in gravitational potential on a device that responds to momentum is compared with the effect of another such pair. Measurement on interval scales which have a common unit follows from these axioms; usually these scales can be converted in a natural way into ratio scales.},

Four major aspects of emotional intelligence, the appraisal and expression of emotion, the use of emotion to enhance cognitive processes and decision making, knowledge about emotions, and management of emotions, are described. Then, I propose how emotional intelligence contributes to effective leadership by focusing on five essential elements of leader effectiveness: development of collective goals and objectives; instilling in others an appreciation of the importance of work activities; generating and maintaining enthusiasm, confidence, optimism, cooperation, and trust; encouraging flexibility in decision making and change; and establishing and maintaining a meaningful identity for an organization.},

The second study examined associations between scores on questionnaire measures of fear/anxiety and performance in a military training setting; regression analysis revealed that fear captured significant variance in performance that was not shared with anxiety.

Mindfulness is an open or receptive awareness of and attention to what is taking place in the present. The construct has been operationalized in dispositional terms by the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ({MAAS}), a 15-item self-report instrument with a single factor. The scale has been validated in college, working adult, and cancer patient populations. A description of the scale and its validation can be found in Brown and Ryan (2003). The scale is shown below, followed by information about scoring.},

All patients were administered the {BDI}-{II} by a clinical psychologist using a large print version and taking as much time as patients required. Rasch analysis was completed using the {RUMM}2020 software. Where disordered thresholds were identified item rescoring was undertaken. Each item was also examined for Differential Item Functioning. Where misfit to model expectations was identified items were removed in an iterative fashion. The effect of any deletion upon person estimates was examined. Specific tests of unidimensionality were undertaken at each iterative phase. {RESULTS} Rescoring was necessary before Items 1-4, 6, 8-12, 20 and 21 showed ordered thresholds. Three items failed to satisfy model expectations - items 16 (changes in sleeping pattern), 18 (changes in appetite) and 21 (loss of interest in sex) and were deleted - after which good overall fit to the Rasch model was observed. The three items deleted affected person estimates in a significant way such that the 21 item version in this group of patients may be biased because of multidimensionality. {CONCLUSIONS} The {BDI}-{II} in a sample of patients undergoing neurorehabilitation satisfies unidimensional Rasch model expectations in an 18-item format. Some disordering of response categories was evident, but this evidence requires replication before any common rescoring option should be considered.},

A heterogeneous sample of 104 chronic pain outpatients at a multidisciplinary pain clinic in Australia completed psychometrically sound self-report measures of major variables in this model: Pain intensity, negative affect, pain catastrophizing, pain-related fear, pain hypervigilance, and functional disability. Two measures of mindfulness were also used, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale [4] and the Five-Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire [1]. Results showed that mindfulness significantly negatively predicts each of these variables, accounting for 17-41\% of their variance. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that mindfulness uniquely predicts pain catastrophizing when other variables are controlled, and moderates the relationship between pain intensity and pain catastrophizing. This is the first clear evidence substantiating the strong link between mindfulness and pain catastrophizing, and suggests mindfulness might be added to the fear-avoidance model. Implications for the clinical use of mindfulness in screening and intervention are discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this Editorial the authors wanted to raise awareness concerning some of the problems the authors believe to have been identified regarding convergent and discriminant validation efforts. Summarizing the thoughts outlined above, the authors stress three aspects that papers reporting validation studies should follow: (1) The trait to be measured should be clearly defined and embedded within a nomological network. (2) Besides convergent validity, discriminant validity is important in order to gain a more complete picture of the validity of an instrument. To this end, different traits have to be assessed with different methods. The nomological network should guide the selection of the discriminant trait(s). (3) Effects of method variance should be modeled. This Editorial also suggests the need for more research in the areas of method variance producing, phenomena effects of item context, and the facet structure underlying and defining broad domains.

	abstract = {Circular layout is very useful to represent complicated information, especially for genomic data. It has advantages to visualize data with long axes or large amount of categories, described with different measurements. It is also effective to visualize relations between elements. Circos (http://circos.ca) is an extraordinarily cool tool to make such circular layout and it is broadly used in real applications, not just popular in Genomic but in a lot of other areas as well. It is not only a way to visualize data, but also enhances the representation of scientific results into a level of aesthetics. Therefore, most people call figures with circular layout as 'circos plot'. Here the circlize package 1 aims to implement Circos in R. One important advantage for the implementation in R is that R is an ideal environment which provides seamless connection between data analysis and data visualization. This package is not a front-end wrapper to generate configuration files for Circos, but completely coded in R style by using R's elegant statistical and graphic engine. We aim to keep the flexibility and configurability of Circos, also make the package more straightforward to use and enhance it to support more types of graphics.},

Despite this, a comprehensive summary of the potential sources of method biases and how to control for them does not exist.

	abstract = {Innovative approaches are urgently needed to improve behavioral treatment for weight loss. The weight regain that is so common after treatment may be a result of an environment that makes it challenging to adhere, long-term, to a dietary and physical activity regimen. This study was designed to test, via a 12-week open trial, the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and possible mechanisms of action of a behavioral treatment that was modified to incorporate acceptance-based therapy components designed to (a) bolster participants' commitment to behavior change, (b) build distress-tolerance skills, and (c) promote mindful awareness of eating behaviors and goals. Participants (n = 29) were overweight or obese women. Among completers (n = 19; 34\% attrition), weight loss averaged 6.6\% of body weight at posttreatment and 9.6\% at 6-month follow-up (n = 14; 52\% attrition). Intention-to-treat weight losses were 4.5\% at posttreatment and 6.6\% at 6-month follow-up. Psychological variables targeted by the intervention (e.g., cognitive restraint, disinhibition, urge-related eating behavior, emotional eating, eating-related experiential acceptance, mindfulness and motivation) changed in the expected directions, and many of these changes were consistent with decreases in weight loss. Moreover, despite the limitations of the single-group design, this pilot study demonstrated the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a novel, acceptance-based behavioral treatment for obesity. One potential implication is that behaviorally based weight loss interventions might be improved by overlaying an acceptance-based framework.},

Vielmehr erfüllt der Homo Oe- conomicus als Erklärungskonzept aggregierten menschlichen Verhaltens eine methodologi- sche Funktion.

Generalizations to other cases, such as multivariate and nonlinear analysis, are also discussed. It can easily be shown that every popular linear analysis can be derived from understanding {MCRA}},

Prior work has not related individual differences in amygdala or subgenual {AC} activation with neuroticism. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate changes in blood oxygen level-dependent signal within the amygdala and subgenual {AC} associated with trait neuroticism in a nonclinical sample of 36 volunteers during an emotional conflict task. Neuroticism correlated positively with amygdala and subgenual {AC} activation during trials of high emotional conflict, compared with trials of low emotional conflict. The subscale of neuroticism that reflected the anxious form of neuroticism (N1) explained a greater proportion of variance within the observed clusters than the subscale of neuroticism that reflected the depressive form of neuroticism (N3). Using a task that is sensitive to individual differences in the detection of emotional conflict, the authors have provided a neural correlate of the link between neuroticism and anxiety and mood disorders. This effect was driven to a greater extent by the anxious relative to the depressive characteristics of neuroticism and may constitute vulnerability markers for anxiety-related disorders.},

1 Regional Primate Research Center and Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7330Submitted 13 September 1999.accepted in final form 11 May 2000.Abstract To investigate whether the simian light reflex is a reasonable model for the human light reflex, we elicited pupillary responses in three behaving rhesus macaques. We measured the change in pupillary area in response to brief (100 ms), intermediate (1 s), and long (3--5 s) light flashes delivered by light-emitting diodes while the monkey fixated a stationary target. Individual responses in the same monkey to either 100-ms or 1-s stimuli of the same light intensity were quite variable. Nevertheless, in response to the 100-ms stimulus, average pupillary constriction and peak constriction velocity increased and latency decreased linearly with the log of stimulus luminance. The minimum average constriction latency across monkeys for the brightest flash was 136 ms. A linear decrease of constriction latency with stimulus luminance also occurs in humans, but their latencies are ∼70 ms longer. In addition, peak constriction velocity was highly correlated with the decrease in pupillary area. Dilation metrics were not as well related to stimulus luminance as were constriction metrics. The latency from flash offset to the onset of dilation was relatively constant, averaging ∼480 ms. Peak dilation velocity was also correlated, but less well, with the increase in pupillary area. Constriction generally was greater and of longer duration for 1-s light pulses than for 100-ms pulses of equal luminance. The initial time courses of the responses to the two stimuli of different durations were identical until ∼150 ms after response onset. Human pupillary responses for long and short flashes also have identical initial time courses. For very long (3--5 s) and very bright constant-luminance stimuli, the simian pupil underwent oscillations at frequencies of 0.9--1.6 Hz. Similar oscillations, called hippus, occur in the human pupillary light reflex. Like humans, the monkeys also exhibited consensual and binocular pupillary responses. Except for response latency, the pupillary responses in the two primate species are otherwise quite similar. Therefore any knowledge we gain about the neuronal substrate of the simian light reflex can be expected to have considerable relevance when extrapolated to humans.

	volume = {30},
	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the Nursing Severity Index, a new method used to measure the admission severity of illness of hospital patients using nursing diagnoses, which categorize biologic, functional, cognitive, and psychosocial abnormalities. This retrospective cohort study with independent development and testing phases was conducted at a U.S. academic medical center. In the development phase, data regarding 14,183 adult medical-surgical patients admitted to the medical center in 1985 and 1986 was used. In the testing phase, data regarding 7,302 patients admitted in 1987 and 1988 was used. Primary nurses prospectively recorded the presence or absence of 61 nursing diagnoses on admission. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from hospital data bases. In the development phase, the number of admission nursing diagnoses was highly related (P {\textless} 0.001) to in-hospital mortality. Using multiple logistic regression, 34 nursing diagnoses were identified as independent predictors of mortality; the Nursing Severity Index equals the number of these 34 diagnoses. In the testing phase of 7,302 patients, the Nursing Severity Index was related (P {\textless} 0.001) to mortality rates, which were 0.5\%, 1\%, 2\%, 6\%, 13\%, 22\%, and 31\% in seven hierarchical strata defined by the Index. The Index was as accurate in predicting mortality as {MedisGroups} (receiver-operating-characteristic curve areas, 0.814 ± 0.016 vs. 0.845 ± 0.015, respectively, P = 0.12). Furthermore, the Nursing Severity Index and {MedisGroups} together (receiver operating caracteristic curve area 0.880 ± 0.014), were more accurate (P {\textless} 0.01) than either measure alone. The Nursing Severity Index assesses multiple dimensions of illness, can be easily measured during rutine patient care, accurately predicts the risk of in-hospital death, and has similar prognostic accuracy as {MedisGroups}. Its usefulness in outcomes assessment, quality assurance, and case management merits further study.},

To date, {NMDS} systems have tended to examine physical nursing care provided in institutional settings, with implications for construct and content validity.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether acceptance is also associated with better well-being in patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome ({CFS}).Methods Ninety-seven patients completed a battery of questionnaires measuring fatigue, functional impairment, psychological distress, and acceptance.Results Results indicated that acceptance has a positive effect upon fatigue and psychological aspects of well-being. More specifically, acceptance was related to more emotional stability and less psychological distress, beyond the effects of demographic variables, and fatigue severity.Conclusion We suggest that promoting acceptance in patients with {CFS} may often be more beneficial than trying to control largely uncontrollable symptoms.},

	abstract = {The high incidence and the severe symptoms of cancer have a considerable effect on quality of life in patients. The relationship between quality of life in patients with cancer and treatment, early diagnosis, disease acceptance, pain, psychological distress, loss of organ, duration of disease, and caregivers was investigated. This study included 508 patients with cancer treated in either inpatient or outpatient clinics of 5 oncology centers in Ankara, Turkey, between August 1998 and January 2000. Patients were selected by interviews. Data were collected by a questionnaire to determine disease features and to evaluate patients' quality of life. We found that several disease features, including treatment, early diagnosis, disease acceptance, pain, psychological distress, and caregivers, had an effect on patients' quality of life (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas loss of organ and duration of disease did not. The results of this study underline the significant effect of psychosocial care programs on quality of life. In the future, assessments of quality of life can help healthcare personnel to prepare psychosocial care programs. (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

	abstract = {Unlike any time before in our lives, we have access to vast amounts of free information. With the right tools, we can start to make sense of all this data to see patterns and trends that would otherwise be invisible to us. By transforming numbers into graphical shapes, we allow readers to understand the stories those numbers hide. In this practical introduction to understanding and using information graphics, you'll learn how to use data visualizations as tools to see beyond lists of numbers and variables and achieve new insights into the complex world around us. Regardless of the kind of data you're working with--business, science, politics, sports, or even your own personal finances--this book will show you how to use statistical charts, maps, and explanation diagrams to spot the stories in the data and learn new things from it. You'll also get to peek into the creative process of some of the world's most talented designers and visual journalists, including Condé Nast Traveler's John Grimwade, National Geographic Magazine's Fernando Baptista, The New York Times' Steve Duenes, The Washington Post's Hannah Fairfield, Hans Rosling of the Gapminder Foundation, Stanford's Geoff {McGhee}, and European superstars Moritz Stefaner, Jan Willem Tulp, Stefanie Posavec, and Gregor Aisch. The book also includes a {DVD}-{ROM} containing over 90 minutes of video lessons that expand on core concepts explained within the book and includes even more inspirational information graphics from the world's leading designers. The first book to offer a broad, hands-on introduction to information graphics and visualization, The Functional Art reveals: * Why data visualization should be thought of as “functional art” rather than fine art * How to use color, type, and other graphic tools to make your information graphics more effective, not just better looking * The science of how our brains perceive and remember information ¿ * Best practices for creating interactive information graphics * A comprehensive look at the creative process behind successful information graphics ¿ * An extensive gallery of inspirational work from the world's top designers and visual {artistsOn} the {DVD}-{ROM}:In this introductory video course on information graphics, Alberto Cairo goes into greater detail with even more visual examples of how to create effective information graphics that function as practical tools for aiding perception. You'll learn how to: incorporate basic design principles in your visualizations, create simple interfaces for interactive graphics, and choose the appropriate type of graphic forms for your data. Cairo also deconstructs successful information graphics from The New York Times and National Geographic magazine with sketches and images not shown in the book.All of Peachpit's {eBooks} contain the same content as the print edition. You will find a link in the last few pages of your {eBook} that directs you to the media files. Helpful tips: If you are able to search the book, search for "Where are the lesson files?"

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The use of large clinical datasets to assess the effectiveness of health care is of growing interest in continuing efforts to understand the impact of healthcare costs on quality. Correspondingly, there is a greater need to define and measure outcomes that are sensitive to nursing interventions. However, concerns exist about the ability to amass and use large clinical nursing datasets to assess the effectiveness of nursing interventions. Some nursing studies have used large clinical datasets to examine patterns of nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes. Among patient populations, however, systematic effectiveness studies of nursing process and outcome linkages at the individual nurse and patient level of analysis are essentially nonexistent. This is largely the result of slow development of nursing classifications, reference terminologies, and reference information standards. Nursing information systems have an unprecedented potential for documentation of nursing practice, as well as the accumulation and analysis of large clinical datasets, to improve nursing performance, increase nursing knowledge, and provide data and information necessary for nursing to participate in the formulation of healthcare policy. {OBJECTIVES}: A literature search shows that a common framework is beginning to evolve that represents nursing's essential information, eg, the Nursing Minimum Data Set, Management Minimum Data Set, and several standardized nursing languages. Extensive research and other initiatives have produced 1) nursing languages and reference terminologies that span healthcare settings; 2) information models; and 3) standards for datasets supporting information systems. A number of issues remain, however, that concern the development of uniform nursing datasets, definitions of outcomes, quality of nursing data, information system design, and methods of data analysis. We review nursing process outcome research, clarify issues inherent in nursing effectiveness research, and discuss implications for nursing and health policy.},

	abstract = {Previous work on the aesthetics of simple figures such as rectangles and triangles, as well as on the aesthetics of color, suggests that although there are clear population level preferences, there are also large individual differences which are temporally stable, and which any adequate theoretical analysis must take into account. Data presented here show similar phenomena in a related problem in composition---where to place an object within the frame of a picture to produce the optimal aesthetic effect. A novel and powerful "method of randomized paired comparisons" first showed that there are overall population level preferences, with objects being placed preferentially at the two golden sections horizontally, and between the two golden sections vertically. As in the studies of simple figures and colors, there are large individual differences. A cognitive model of "sensory aesthetics" is proposed in which continua of any type (space, geometric objects, colors, or whatever), are described categorically, usually in terms of words such as "square," "rectangle," "line," etc., each of which is a fuzzy set. Preference functions are then derived from the union and intersection of the fuzzy set functions, which differ between individuals as their categories differ or as they prefer objects which are prototypical, or are at the boundaries between prototypes. There is therefore wide inter-individual variability.},

@article{Jensen2011,
	title = {Mindfulness training affects attention-or is it attentional effort?},
	abstract = {Improvements in attentional performance are at the core of proposed mechanisms for stress reduction in mindfulness meditation practices. However, this claim can be questioned because no previous studies have actively manipulated test effort in control groups and controlled for effects of stress reduction per se. In a blinded design, 48 young, healthy meditation novices were randomly assigned to a mindfulness-based stress reduction ({MBSR}), nonmindfulness stress reduction ({NMSR}), or inactive control group. At posttest, inactive controls were randomly split into nonincentive and incentive controls, the latter receiving a financial reward to improve attentional performance. Pre- and postintervention, 5 validated attention paradigms were employed along with self-report scales on mindfulness and perceived stress and saliva cortisol samples to measure physiological stress. Attentional effects of {MBSR}, {NMSR}, and the financial incentive were comparable or significantly larger in the incentive group on all reaction-time-based measures. However, selective attention in the {MBSR} group improved significantly more than in any other group. Similarly, only the {MBSR} intervention improved the threshold for conscious perception and visual working memory capacity. Furthermore, stress-reducing effects of {MBSR} were supported because those in the {MBSR} group showed significantly less perceived and physiological stress while increasing their mindfulness levels significantly. We argue that {MBSR} may contribute uniquely to attentional improvements but that further research focusing on non-reaction-time-based measures and outcomes less confounded by test effort is needed. Critically, our data demonstrate that previously observed improvements of attention after {MBSR} may be seriously confounded by test effort and nonmindfulness stress reduction.

	title = {Rasch fit statistics as a test of the invariance of item parameter estimates},
	volume = {4},
	abstract = {The invariance of the estimated parameters across variation in the incidental parameters of a sample is one of the most important properties of Rasch measurement models. This is the property that allows the equating of test forms and the use of computer adaptive testing. It necessarily follows that in Rasch models if the data fit the model, than the estimation of the parameter of interest must be invariant across sub-samples of the items or persons. This study investigates the degree to which the {INFIT} and {OUTFIT} item fit statistics in {WINSTEPS} detect violations of the invariance property of Rasch measurement models. The test in this study is a 80 item multiple-choice test used to assess mathematics competency. The {WINSTEPS} analysis of the dichotomous results, based on a sample of 2000 from a very large number of students who took the exam, indicated that only 7 of the 80 items misfit using the 1.3 mean square criteria advocated by Linacre and Wright. Subsequent calibration of separate samples of 1,000 students from the upper and lower third of the person raw score distribution, followed by a t-test comparison of the item calibrations, indicated that the item difficulties for 60 of the 80 items were more than 2 standard errors apart. The separate calibration t-values ranged from +21.00 to -7.00 with the t-test value of 41 of the 80 comparisons either larger than +5 or smaller than -5. Clearly these data do not exhibit the invariance of the item parameters expected if the data fit the model. Yet the {INFIT} and {OUTFIT} mean squares are completely insensitive to the lack of invariance in the item parameters. If the {OUTFIT} {ZSTD} from {WINSTEPS} was used with a critical value of {\textbar} t {\textbar} {\textgreater} 2.0, then 56 of the 60 items identified by the separate calibration t-test would be identified as misfitting. A fourth measure of misfit, the between ability-group item fit statistic identified 69 items as misfitting when a critical value of t {\textgreater} 2.0 was used. Clearly relying solely on the {INFIT} and {OUTFIT} mean squares in {WINSETPS} to assess the fit of the data to the model would cause one to miss one of the most important threats to the usefulness of the measurement model.},

	doi = {10.1177/1745691611427305},
	abstract = {The measurement of pupil diameter in psychology (in short, �pupillometry�) has just celebrated 50 years. The method established itself after the appearance of three seminal studies (Hess \& Polt, 1960, 1964; Kahneman \& Beatty, 1966). Since then, the method has continued to play a significant role within the field, and pupillary responses have been successfully used to provide an estimate of the �intensity� of mental activity and of changes in mental states, particularly changes in the allocation of attention and the consolidation of perception. Remarkably, pupillary responses provide a continuous measure regardless of whether the participant is aware of such changes. More recently, research in neuroscience has revealed a tight correlation between the activity of the locus coeruleus (i.e., the �hub� of the noradrenergic system) and pupillary dilation. As we discuss in this short review, these neurophysiological findings provide new important insights to the meaning of pupillary responses for mental activity. Finally, given that pupillary responses can be easily measured in a noninvasive manner, occur from birth, and can occur in the absence of voluntary, conscious processes, they constitute a very promising tool for the study of preverbal (e.g., infants) or nonverbal participants (e.g., animals, neurological patients).},

In biomedical research, we are in the midst of a revolution with the generation of new data and scientific publications at a previously unprecedented rate. However, unfortunately, there is compelling evidence that the majority of these discoveries will not stand the test of time. To a large extent, this reproducibility crisis in basic and preclinical research may be as a result of failure to adhere to good scientific practice and the desperation to publish or perish. This is a multifaceted, multistakeholder problem. No single party is solely responsible, and no single solution will suffice. Here we review the reproducibility problems in basic and preclinical biomedical research, highlight some of the complexities, and discuss potential solutions that may help improve research quality and reproducibility.},

In general, these findings are consistent with a social-role theory of sex differences, which emphasizes the causal impact of gender roles-that is, of people's beliefs about the behavior that is appropriate for each sex. To move beyond the demonstration of consistency between role expectations and social behavior, meta-analyses have examined the moderators and mediators specified by this theoretical model The outcomes of these moderator and mediator analyses are illustrated from several meta-analyses of gender and social behavior. These meta-analyses thus show that quantitative reviewing is not limited to the mere summarizing of research findings; the technique also allows reviewers to examine the plausibility of theories that are relevant to these findings.},

	abstract = {Nursing diagnoses represent individual reactions to existing or potential changes in one's state of health. They are result of a diagnostic process, which is part of the dynamic nursing care process in its whole. Thus, as a basis of nursing interventions diagnoses have to be proved continuously. The classification of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association ({NANDA}) as well as the International Classification for Nursing Practice ({ICNP}) can be account to the international well-known classifications of nursing diagnoses. Comparing their structures, some fundamental differences between both classifications become obvious. While the {NANDA} classification represents a systematic structured body of nursing knowledge with regard to human health reactions patterns, the {ICNP} reflects a more comprehensive part of the nursing reality, since it also contains nursing interventions and outcomes. Until the latest changes by establishing the taxonomy {II}, {NANDA} diagnoses have primarily focused deficits. But in contrast to the diagnoses of the {ICNP} they also comprise etiological factors. To prove the applicability of both classifications to nursing practice, they have been applied to a case study of a female resident living in a nursing home. The results of analysis show that because of their different structures the {NANDA} classification and {ICNP} have their own possibilities and limitations in covering the resident's individual needs of nursing care. These characteristic potentials and restrictions have to be taken into account when one of the classification systems is going to be implemented into nursing practice.},

Their responses to potentially self-threatening experiences subsequently were rated for the extent to which they reflected openness and honesty as opposed to defensiveness. Our findings indicated that authenticity and mindfulness correlated positively and that higher scores on each related to lower levels of verbal defensiveness. Additional analyses revealed that the relation between authenticity and verbal defensiveness was indirect, mediated by mindfulness. These findings support the view that higher authenticity and mindfulness relate to greater tendencies to engage self-relevant information in a relatively non-defensive manner.},

Correlation does not imply causation, and yet causal conclusions drawn from a carefully designed experiment are often valid. What can a statistical model say about causation? This question is addressed by using a particular model for causal inference (Holland and Rubin 1983; Rubin 1974) to critique the discussions of other writers on causation and causal inference. These include selected philosophers, medical researchers, statisticians, econometricians, and proponents of causal modeling.},

Method. A systematic literature review was carried out. Electronic searches were performed in Pubmed, Embase, {PsycINFO}, {CINAHL} and {SSCI}. Qualitative content analysis of statements about {PF} was conducted using inductive coding. Results. The searches yielded 353 citations, 79 papers were eligible for analyses. Five hundred thirty-eight statements about {PF} were extracted, condensed and coded. Beside conceptual statements, 238 examples of potential {PF} as well as five attempts at classifying {PF} were found in the literature. {PF} were considered in relation to clinical service provision, assessment and intervention, in research and social security contexts. {PF} were seen to be related to various aspects of health, functioning, disability and the environment. Conclusions. The analysis of the literature shows that {PF} is seen as relevant to the application of the {ICF} in various settings. The review revealed a need for standardisation of {PF}. The literature points to the potential of {PF} in enhancing the understanding of functioning, disability and health, in facilitating interventions and services for people with disabilities, and strengthening the perspective of individuals in the {ICF}.},

We identify three high-leverage instructional practices for enculturatingmindfulness: looking closely, exploring possibilities and perspectives, and introducing ambiguity. We conclude by exploring what it might look like to cultivate the trait of mindfulness within individual classrooms. This report includes a review of an experimental study of `conditional instruction,' which explores mindfulness as a state, and then drawson a series of qualitative case studies of `thoughtful' classrooms to provide an example of conditional instruction as it might serve to develop a disposition of mindfulness.},

	title = {Descriptive {IRT} vs. Prescriptive Rasch},
	volume = {5},
	url = {http://www.rasch.org/rmt/rmt51f.htm},
	abstract = {Descriptive {IRT} vs. Prescriptive Rasch Item response theory ({IRT}) generally refers to three probabilistic measurement models: the 1-parameter (identical to the dichotomous Rasch model), the 2-parameter, and the 3-parameter, named by the number of item parameters estimated in each model. All three models can be specified from a single probabilistic function for the occurrence of a right answer by a person to an item: P(x=1) = ci - (1-ci) exp (ai(t-bi)) / (1 + exp (ai(t-bi))) where the three item parameters are ci = low asymptote of ogive (guessing) bi = median intercept of ogive (difficulty) ai = slope of ogive at inflection (discrimination) and the one person parameter is t = ability of a person on the variable. Making ci constant produces 2-parameter estimation. Making ai constant produces 1-parameter estimation. This approach seems to imply that the Rasch model is just a stripped- down version of more complicated models which "must be better" because they account for more of the "presumed reality" of traditional test theory. Quite apart from Occam's razor (that entities are not multiplied beyond necessity), this interpretation is shallow in an essential way. That the Rasch model can be reached by simplifying more complicated models has nothing to do with its genesis or rationale, or with the theory of measurement. The Rasch model is not intended to fit data or to be evaluated by how well it fits any particular data set. The Rasch model is a definition of measurement derived from the universally accepted measurement requirements that: 1. The measures of objects be free of the particulars of the agents used to estimate these measures and the calibrations of agents be free of the particulars of the objects used to estimate these calibrations. 2. The measures of objects and calibrations of agents function according to the rules of arithmetic on a common scale so that they can be analyzed statistically. 3. Linear combinations of measures and calibrations correspond to plausible concatenations of objects and agents. Introducing the superfluous parameters, ai and ci, violates these requirements and disqualifies the resulting contrivances as "measurement" models. Were the values of t known prior to analysis, the 2- and 3-parameter formulations could be used to specify two, among many possible, logistic regressions, as they have been in biometric analysis for 60 years. When t is not known and must be estimated from the same data, as is the case for measurement, then it can be demonstrated algebraically that the parameter estimates must diverge unless constrained in an arbitrary manner. In practice, arbitrary interference, such as limiting the range of ai and ci, does not produce sample-free item calibrations or test-free person measures - unless ai and ci are restricted to constants, when, of course, the formulation becomes a Rasch model and functions accordingly. This is the misunderstanding of those who claim the 2- and 3-parameter computer programs "work". In the few instances where serious 2- and 3-parameter results are reported, their quality is proportional to the extent to which ai and ci were kept from varying - from being influenced by the data. Indeed all important practical {IRT} applications reported at the 1991 {AERA} meeting were implemented by the Rasch model. In theory and in practice, the Rasch model is a unique measurement archetype.},

We have summarized the study results based on their main research focus as follows: studies on neural correlates of reward processing (alcohol cues (N = 17), non-drug cues (N = 3)), decision making (N = 2), attention (N = 5), impulsivity and cognitive control (N = 1), pharmacological effects/treatment responses (N = 13) and relapse prediction (N = 6). Neuroimaging genetics studies have mainly considered the impact of various functional polymorphisms on alcohol cue processing (N = 10). These results indicate that recent research on {AUDs} has concentrated on reward processing (mainly alcohol cue reactivity). Possible directions for future research are discussed.},

We systematically reviewed the literature to identify studies examining the epidemiology of joint contracture regardless of clinical condition. Epidemiologic measures of interest were prevalence, incidence, and prognostic risk factors. We used Medline to identify all epidemiologic studies of major joint contractures published from 1966 to March 2005. There was a high prevalence of major joint contractures. Most studies focused on one joint rather than including all relevant major contractures. However, most studies did provide a definition of a contracture or the measures used to assess contractures. Immobility is a highly prevalent disability in at-risk populations, and constitutes a tremendous burden to patients in nursing homes, hospitals, and the outpatient community. The lack of epidemiologic data is a major impediment to providing appropriate treatment. Level of Evidence: Level {III}, systematic review.

Insight in its factor structure and dimensionality could help to develop more homogeneous {IDS}-{SR} subscales. However previous factoranalytical studies have found mixed results. Therefore, the present study tested which factor structure underlies the {IDS}-{SR} and, in addition, if the factors can be used as unidimensional subscales.Methods{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) was done to identify the best-fitting factor structure. The study sample consisted of 2600 individuals (mean age 40.5 ± 12.1). We assessed model fit in 4 groups: 957 Major Depressive Disorder ({MDD}) patients, 450 remitted {MDD} patients, 570 patients with an anxiety disorder and 623 healthy controls to test the consistency of model fit. Rasch analyses in the full sample were used to evaluate and optimize the unidimensionality and psychometric quality of the factors.Results{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{CFA} indicated that a 3-factor model fits the {IDS}-{SR} data best and is consistent across groups, with a [`]mood/cognition' factor, an [`]anxiety/arousal' factor and a [`]sleep' factor.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES} The purpose of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of the International Classification of Nursing Practice (1) ({ICPN}) Version 1.0 as a representational model for nursing assessment documentation. {DESIGN} {AND} {MEASUREMENTS} To identify representational requirements of nursing assessments, the authors mapped key concepts and semantic relations extracted from standardized and local nursing admission assessment documentation forms/templates and inpatient admission assessment records to the {ICNP}. Next, they expanded the list of {ICNP} semantic relations with those obtained from the admission assessment forms/templates. The expanded {ICNP} semantic relations were then validated against the semantic relations identified from an additional set of admission assessment records and a set of 300 randomly selected North American Nursing Diagnosis Association defining characteristic phrases. The concept coverage of the {ICNP} was evaluated by mapping the concepts extracted from these sources to the {ICNP} concepts. The {UMLS} Methathesaurus was then used to map concepts without exact matches to other American Nursing Association ({ANA}) recognized terminologies. {RESULTS} The authors found that along with the 30 existing {ICNP} semantic relations, an additional 17 are required for the {ICNP} to function as a representational model for nursing assessment documentation. Eight hundred and five unique assessment concepts were extracted from all sources. Forty-three percent of these unique assessment concepts had exact matches in the {ICNP}. An additional 20\% had matches in the {ICNP} classified as narrower, broader, or "other." Of the concepts without exact matches in the {ICNP}, 81\% had exact matches found in other {ANA} recognized terminologies. {CONCLUSIONS} The broad concept coverage and the logic-based structure of the {ICNP} make it a flexible and robust standard. The {ICNP} provides a framework from which to capture and reuse atomic level data to facilitate evidence-based practice.},

Before and after the intervention period, questionnaires were completed on psychological well-being, quality of life, and mindfulness. {RESULTS}: Repeated measures multiple analysis of variance ({MANCOVAs}) showed that, compared with the control group, the intervention resulted in significantly stronger reductions of perceived stress (p = 0.016) and vital exhaustion (p = 0.001) and stronger elevations of positive affect (p = 0.006), quality of life (p = .009), as well as mindfulness (p = 0.001). When mindfulness was included as a covariate in the {MANCOVA}, the group effects on perceived stress and quality of life were reduced to nonsignificance. {CONCLUSION}: Increased mindfulness may, at least partially, mediate the positive effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention.},

The research had two main objectives: to contribute to the identification and definition of concepts that represent nursing knowledge in obstetrics and to participate in the validation of the International Classification for Nursing Practice ({ICNP})®. {METHODS} Using a qualitative approach, the study was designed in three phases. The first phase aimed to identify the terms and expressions used by nurses in nursing documentation and oral report, using document analysis, observation and interview as data collection methods. The second phase intended to determine which terms and expressions corresponded to {ICNP}® concepts. The third phase aimed to analyse the definition of some {ICNP}® concepts. In both the second and third phases, a consensus approach was used based on the Delphi Technique. {ICNP}® concepts were identified from the words and expressions used by nurses and midwives to describe their practice. {RESULTS} The results of this study suggested modifications on some {ICNP}® concept definitions, namely burping, bonding, mother-child attachment, infant sucking, false labour pain, aborting, and uterine contraction; and the inclusion of specific characteristics in others, i.e. uterine expulsion, breast engorgement, colic, and hunger. New {ICNP}® concepts were also suggested, specifically mother-foetal attachment, uterine contraction after labour, pain after labour and foetal well-being. {CONCLUSION} The study confirmed that {ICNP}® is an important instrument to identify the concepts needed to describe mother and child needs during the perinatal period.},

One mechanism through which mindfulness may reduce psychological symptoms and promote functioning is enhancing emotional responding and regulation. In this study, we used multimodal assessment to examine the effects of a brief mindfulness intervention in a laboratory setting on emotional experiences and regulation in response to distressing, positive, and affectively mixed film clips. Although there were no condition (mindfulness vs. control) effects on reports of emotional response or difficulties in regulation after the distressing film clip, participants in the mindfulness condition reported significantly greater positive affect in response to the positive film. Additionally, participants in the mindfulness condition reported more adaptive regulation (approaching significance, medium to large effect size) in response to the affectively mixed clip and significantly less negative affect immediately after this clip, although not after a recovery period. No significant differences emerged between conditions on physiological measures (skin conductance and heart rate) throughout the study.},

	abstract = {{\textless}{AbstractText} Label="{INTRODUCTION}" {NlmCategory}="{BACKGROUND}"{\textgreater}The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire ({FIQ}) is a composite disease-specific measure validated for fibromyalgia ({FM}), but it is rarely used in clinical practice. The objective was to develop and analyse the psychometric properties of a new composite disease-specific index (Fibromyalgia Assessment Status, {FAS}), a simple self-administered index that combines a patient's assessment of fatigue, sleep disturbances and pain evaluated on the basis of the 16 non-articular sites listed on the Self-Assessment Pain Scale ({SAPS}) in a single measure (range 0 to 10).{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater} {\textless}{AbstractText} Label="{METHODS}" {NlmCategory}="{METHODS}"{\textgreater}The {FAS} index was constructed using a traditional development strategy, and its psychometric properties were tested in 226 {FM} patients (209 women, 17 men); whose disease-related characteristics were assessed by means of an 11-numbered circular numerical rating scale ({NRS}) for pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances and general health ({GH}), the tender point score ({TPS}), the {SAPS}, the {FIQ}, and the {SF}-36. A group of 226 rheumatoid arthritis ({RA}) patients was used for comparative purposes. Of the 179 {FM} patients who entered the follow-up study, 152 completed the three-month period and were included in the responsiveness analyses. One hundred and fifty-four patients repeated the {FAS} questionnaire after an interval of one week, and its test/re-test reliability was calculated. Responsiveness was evaluated on the basis of effect size and the standardised response mean.{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater} {\textless}{AbstractText} Label="{RESULTS}" {NlmCategory}="{RESULTS}"{\textgreater}The {FAS} index fulfilled the established criteria for validity, reliability and responsiveness. Factor analysis showed that {SAPS} and fatigue contributed most, and respectively explained 47.4\% and 31.2\% of the variance; sleep explained 21.3\%. Testing for internal consistency showed that Cronbach's alpha was 0.781, thus indicating a high level of reliability. As expected, closer significant correlations were found when {FAS} was compared with total {FIQ} (rho = 0.347; P {\textless} 0.0001) and the {FIQ} subscales, particularly job ability, tiredness, fatigue and pain (all P {\textless} 0.0001), but the correlation between {FAS} and the mental component summary scale score ({MCS}) of the {SF}-36 (rho = -0.531; P {\textless} 0.0001) was particularly interesting. Test/re-test reliability was satisfactory. The {FAS} showed the greatest effect size. The magnitude of the responsiveness measures was statistically different between {FAS} (0.889) and the {FIQ} (0.781) (P = 0.038), and between the {SF}-36 {MCS} (0.434) and the {SF}-36 physical component summary scale score ({PCS}) (0.321) (P {\textless} 0.01).{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater} {\textless}{AbstractText} Label="{CONCLUSIONS}" {NlmCategory}="{CONCLUSIONS}"{\textgreater}The self-administered {FAS} is a reliable, valid and responsive disease-specific composite measure for assessing treatment effect in patients with {FM}.{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater}},

The purpose of this study was to identify psychosocial health resources and risk factors in profession-related behaviour and experience patterns of medical students and physicians that may serve as a basis for appropriate health promoting interventions.{METHODS}:The questionnaire -Related Behaviour and Experience "Work administered in cross-sectional surveys to students in the first (n = 475) and in the fifth year of studies (n = 355) in required courses at three German universities and to physicians in early professional life in the vicinity of these universities (n = 381).{RESULTS}:Scores reflecting a healthy behaviour pattern were less likely in physicians (16.7\%) compared to 5th year (26.0\%) and 1st year students (35.1\%) while scores representing unambitious and resigned patterns were more common among physicians (43.4\% vs. 24.4\% vs. 41.0\% and 27.3\% vs. 17.2\% vs. 23.3 respectively). Female and male responders differed in the domains professional commitment, resistance to stress and emotional well-being. Female physicians on average scored higher in the dimensions resignation tendencies, satisfaction with life and experience of social support, and lower in career ambition.{CONCLUSION}:The results show distinct psychosocial stress patterns among medical students and physicians. Health promotion and prevention of psychosocial symptoms and impairments should be integrated as a required part of the medical curriculum and be considered an important issue during the further training of physicians.},

The International Classification for Nursing Practice ({ICNP}) is a programme of the {ICN}. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and maintenance processes of the {ICNP} Programme that are used to increase participation. These include processes by which the {ICNP} was and continues to be developed, tested, distributed and implemented worldwide, with emphasis on the current version, {ICNP} Version 1.0. The {ICNP} is a unified nursing language that facilitates cross-mapping among local terms and existing terminologies. {ICNP} conforms to current terminology standards and criteria, for example, {ISO} standards and {HL}7. The {ICNP} Alpha and Beta Versions documented the progress of concept validation and classification of nursing phenomena and interventions. The {ICNP} Beta 2 Version was a combinatorial terminology organized in two multi-axial structures representing nursing phenomena and nursing actions. The {ICNP} Version 1.0, launched in 2005, changed the relatively straight-forward multi-axial structure into a compositional terminology through the application of description logics using Web Ontology Language ({OWL}) within Protégé, an ontology development environment. {ICNP} Version 1.0 is also represented in a multiaxial model (7-Axis) for nurses to compose nursing diagnosis, intervention and outcome statements. Language translations and clinical information systems applications are required to make the {ICNP} Version 1.0 available to nurses at the point of healthcare delivery. {ICNP} data collected in healthcare environments provide standardized terminology for nursing that allows comparison of nursing practice across health care settings, specialties and countries; facilitate data-based clinical and management decision making; and contribute to the development of guidelines and standards for best practices and optimal outcomes for patients, families and communities.},

Little information is available on the bilateral symmetry of hip rotational measures in unilaterally dominant upper extremity athletes.Hypothesis: Side-to-side differences in hip joint range of motion may be present because of asymmetrical loading in the lower extremities of elite tennis players and professional baseball pitchers.Study Design: Cohort (cross-sectional) study (prevalence); Level of evidence, 1.Methods: Descriptive measures of hip internal and external rotation active range of motion were taken in the prone position of 64 male and 83 female elite tennis players and 101 male professional baseball pitchers using digital photos and computerized angle calculation software. Bilateral differences in active range of motion between the dominant and nondominant hip were compared using paired t tests and Bonferroni correction for hip internal, external, and total rotation range of motion. A Pearson correlation test was used to test the relationship between years of competition and hip rotation active range of motion.Results: No significant bilateral difference (P {\textgreater} .005) was measured for mean hip internal or external rotation for the elite tennis players or the professional baseball pitchers. An analysis of the number of subjects in each group with a bilateral difference in hip rotation greater than 10 ° identified 17\% of the professional baseball pitchers with internal rotation differences and 42\% with external rotation differences. Differences in the elite male tennis players occurred in only 15\% of the players for internal rotation and 9\% in external rotation. Female subjects had differences in 8\% and 12\% of the players for internal and external rotation, respectively. Statistical differences were found between the mean total arc of hip range of internal and external rotation in the elite tennis players with the dominant side being greater by a clinically insignificant mean value of 2.5 °. Significantly less (P {\textless} .005) dominant hip internal rotation and less dominant and nondominant hip total rotation range of motion were found in the professional baseball pitchers compared with the elite male tennis players.Conclusion: This study established typical range of motion patterns and identified bilaterally symmetric hip active range of motion rotation values in elite tennis players and professional baseball pitchers. Asymmetric hip joint rotational active range of motion encountered during clinical examination and screening may indicate abnormalities and would indicate the application of flexibility training, rehabilitation, and further evaluation.},

This study was undertaken to assess the construct validity and internal reliability of the previously developed Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire ({PSQ}).Method---A total of 1390 patients from five practices in the North of England, the Midlands, and Scotland completed the questionnaire. Responses were checked for construct validity (including confirmatory factor analysis to check the factor structure of the scale) and internal reliability.Results---Confirmatory factor analysis showed that items loaded on the appropriate factors in a five factor model (doctors, nurses, access, appointments, and facilities). Scores on the specific subscales showed highly significant positive correlations with general satisfaction subscale scores suggesting construct validity. Also, the prediction (derived from past research) that older people would be more satisfied with the service was borne out by the results (F (4, 1312) = 57.10; p{\textless}0.0001), providing further construct validation. The five specific subscales (doctors, nurses, access, appointments, and facilities), the general satisfaction subscale, and the questionnaire as a whole were found to have high internal reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.74--0.95).Conclusion---The results suggest that the {PSQ} is a valid and internally reliable tool for assessing patient satisfaction with general practitioner services.

The key performance dimensions include: (1) Link Best Practices to Strategy Fulfillment (2) Best Practice Identification Systems (3) Best Practice Recognition Systems (4) Communicating Best Practices (5) Best Practice Knowledge Sharing Systems (6) Ongoing Nurturing of Best Practices Graphical Presentations, Best Practice Project Maps and Research Organization: The sub-elements to the fully integrated performance system are graphically depicted at the start of the report. At the start of each chapter, a Best Practice Project Map describes: (1) the class of benchmark companies examined in the chapter, (2) the key performance dimensions of the project with the chapter concentration highlighted, and (3) the recommended practices identified among the benchmark class in that sub-element. Best Practice Corporate Profiles, Information Graphics: Best practice descriptions and information are organized and presented under the thematic headings or sub-elements for each performance system. Highly effective practices are identified in bold-faced type and are followed by detailed descriptions of individual companies specific systems and approaches to these practices. For instance, a practice under Communicating Best Practices such as Ensure Communication Among Line and Staff Management is illustrated by a discussion of the various methods Wal-Mart uses to ensure corporate-wide communication (including Saturday morning executive meetings, and video links connecting all stores). At times, the corporate profiles will go into great depth and detail describing a benchmark company's integrated approach to the subject area. Other times the profile will be brief and illustrate a single relevant practice. When relevant, the research team has developed tables and information graphics to visually illustrate key practice areas. Research Sources Tables: Lastly, the report contains a Summary Table detailing the full extent of research sources employed to develop each set of benchmark profiles.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To compare the immediate and medium-term effects of three stretching methods on the knee flexion range in people with a total knee replacement. {DESIGN}: Randomized clinical trial. {SETTING}: Rehabilitation hospital. {SUBJECTS}: 117 patients were recruited and 100 (mean age: 68.43 +/- 7.95 years) of them completed the study. {INTERVENTIONS}: Patients receiving total knee replacement due to knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned into 3 groups of: active stretching (group 1, n =32), passive stretching (group 2, n =35) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching (group 3, n =33). {MAIN} {MEASURES}: The immediate change in both active and passive knee flexion range after the first treatment session and the pattern of change in these ranges throughout the 2-week study period were compared among the three groups. {RESULTS}: All groups demonstrated significant improvement in knee ranges with time. The active range of group 1 improved by 19.9 degrees , group 2 by 25.3 degrees and group 3 by 22.5 degrees throughout the 2-week period, whereas the improvements in the passive range were 18.8 degrees , 24.5 degrees and 22.7 degrees , respectively. For between-group comparisons, no significant difference was found in both active (P = 0.647) and passive (P = 0.501) knee range immediately after stretching. For the changes at 2 weeks, there was also no significant difference among the groups in both active (P = 0.716) and passive (P = 0.959) knee ranges. {CONCLUSION}: This study revealed that all three modes of stretching were associated with an increase in the knee flexion range of patients after total knee replacement, with no statistically significant differences between the changes seen.},

	title = {A Pilot Study Measuring the Impact of Yoga on the Trait of Mindfulness},
	volume = {37},
	abstract = {Background: The current study examined whether yoga would increase levels of mindfulness in a healthy population. Method: Forty-six participants were randomly assigned to an 8-week yoga intervention group or a wait-list control group. Mindfulness was assessed pre and post yoga, using the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory ({FMI}). Results: Results indicate that the yoga group experienced a significant increase in Overall mindfulness, and in three mindfulness subscales; Attention to the present moment, Accepting and open attitudes toward experience, and Insightful understanding (p {\textless} .01). The control group experienced a significant increase in overall mindfulness (p {\textless} .02) and insightful understanding (p {\textless} .01). Findings suggest that a yoga intervention may be a viable method for increasing levels of trait mindfulness in a healthy population, potentially implicating yoga as a preventive method for the later development of negative emotional mood states (i.e. anxiety and depression). The control group also experienced moderate elevations of mindfulness at the second assessment.},

This paper summarizes the results of six studies. {METHODS} Two systematic reviews, instrument development and testing, a pre-post intervention study, and a cluster-randomized trial were performed. {FINDINGS} The {NANDA} International classification met most of the literature-based classification criteria, and results showed the Quality of Nursing Diagnoses, Interventions and Outcomes (Q-{DIO}) to be a reliable instrument to measure the documented quality of nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes. Implementation of standardized nursing language significantly improved the quality of documented nursing diagnoses, related interventions, and patient outcomes. As a follow-up measure, Guided Clinical Reasoning ({GCR}) was effective in supporting nurses' clinical reasoning skills. {CONCLUSIONS} Carefully implementing classifications led to enhanced, accurately stated nursing diagnoses, more effective nursing interventions, and better patient outcomes. {IMPLICATIONS} Rethinking implementation methods for standardized language and using {GCR} is recommended. Based on the results of this study, the inclusion of {NANDA} International diagnoses with related interventions and outcomes in electronic health records is suggested.},

The percentage of agreement of the rating results for the {ICNP} phenomenon axes was between 73\% and 99\%, and the randomly adjusted Cohen's Kappa value was 0.88 on the {ICNP} focus axis. {DISCUSSION} The results of the mapping show that both classifications, {ENP} and {INCP}, are not yet complete for illustrating all aspects of nursing. Both classifications use a large proportion of overlapping terms (75\%), and a small proportion of terms (25\%) which describe different dimensions of nursing in both {ENP} and {ICNP}. {CONCLUSION} The results of the mapping are discussed in consideration of the nurse's perspective. The main focus is on the difference between pre-combined systems, like {ENP}, and post-combined, like {ICNP}, and their implications on the use of nursing classifications in practice for the illustration of the nursing process.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The effects of burnout and perceived stress on early morning free cortisol levels after awakening were investigated in a group of teachers. Previous studies revealed that cortisol levels show a significant increase after awakening, with high intraindividual stability. {METHODS}: Sixty-six teachers from local public schools (42 women and 24 men, mean age 42 ± 5 years) were asked to sample saliva for cortisol analysis on 3 consecutive days. On each day, cortisol levels were measured at the time of awakening and 15, 30, and 60 minutes thereafter. On the night before the third day, subjects took 0.5 mg dexamethasone orally for testing glucocorticoid feedback inhibition. Burnout and perceived stress were measured by three different questionnaires. {RESULTS}: Perceived stress correlated with increases of cortisol levels during the first hour after awakening after dexamethasone pretreatment. In addition, teachers scoring high on burnout showed lower overall cortisol secretion on all sampling days, and a higher suppression of cortisol secretion after dexamethasone administration. In the subgroup of teachers with both high levels of perceived stress and high levels of burnout, a lower overall cortisol secretion was observed on the first 2 days, with stronger increases during the first hour after awakening after dexamethasone suppression. This subgroup also showed the lowest self-esteem, the highest external locus of control, and the highest number of somatic complaints. {CONCLUSIONS}: These results demonstrate differential effects of burnout and perceived stress on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation.},

	abstract = {Fitting distributions consists in finding a mathematical function which represents in a good way a statistical variable. A statistician often is facing with this problem: he has some observations of a quantitative character x1, x2, xn and he wishes to test if those observations, being a sample of an unknown population, belong from a population with a pdf (probability density function) f(x,), where  is a vector of parameters to estimate with available data. We can identify 4 steps in fitting distributions: 1) Model/function choice: hypothesize families of distributions; 2) Estimate parameters; 3) Evaluate quality of fit; 4) Goodness of fit statistical tests. This paper aims to face fitting distributions dealing shortly with theoretical issues and practical ones using the statistical environment and language R1. R is a language and an environment for statistical computing and graphics flexible and powerful. We are going to use some R statements concerning graphical techniques 2.0), model/function choice 3.0), parameters estimate 4.0), measures of goodness of fit 5.0) and most common goodness of fit tests 6.0). To understand this work a basic knowledge of R is needed. We suggest a reading of An introduction to R2. R statements, if not specified, are included in stats package.},

	volume = {44},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Few studies described nursing diagnosis classification criteria and how classifications meet these criteria. {OBJECTIVES} The purpose was to identify criteria for nursing diagnosis classifications and to assess how these criteria are met by different classifications. {DESIGN}/{METHODS} First, a literature review was conducted (N=50) to identify criteria for nursing diagnoses classifications and to evaluate how these criteria are met by the International Classification of Nursing Practice ({ICNP}), the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health ({ICF}), the International Nursing Diagnoses Classification ({NANDA}), and the Nursing Diagnostic System of the Centre for Nursing Development and Research ({ZEFP}). Using literature review based general and specific criteria, the principal investigator evaluated each classification, applying a matrix. Second, a convenience sample of 20 nursing experts from different Swiss care institutions answered standardized interview forms, querying current national and international classification state and use. {RESULTS} The first general criterion is that a diagnosis classification should describe the knowledge base and subject matter for which the nursing profession is responsible. {ICNP}) and {NANDA} meet this goal. The second general criterion is that each class fits within a central concept. The {ICF} and {NANDA} are the only two classifications built on conceptually driven classes. The third general classification criterion is that each diagnosis possesses a description, diagnostic criteria, and related etiologies. Although {ICF} and {ICNP} describe diagnostic terms, only {NANDA} fulfils this criterion. The analysis indicated that {NANDA} fulfilled most of the specific classification criteria in the matrix. The nursing experts considered {NANDA} to be the best-researched and most widely implemented classification in Switzerland and internationally. {CONCLUSIONS} The international literature and the opinion of Swiss expert nurses indicate that-from the perspective of classifying comprehensive nursing diagnoses-{NANDA} should be recommended for nursing practice and electronic nursing documentation. Study limitations and future research needs are discussed.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Nurses have been slow to realise the uniqueness of their data and the importance of data management across the profession. This has resulted in nursing being neglected as a partner in healthcare because the data nurses collect cannot be easily retrieved from the patient record and is not widely used to support nursing practice. Nurses, as they should, have rejected language classification systems that are inadequate or inappropriate, but with the implementation of electronic health records, consensus on language classification must be achieved. One problem has been finding an appropriate terminology/s that represents the spectrum of nursing practice while making sense to both the user and computer. In 1989 the International Council of Nurses began work to achieve this and the International Classification for Nursing Practice ({ICNP}®) was born. This paper provides an insight into language classification, explores the {ICNP}® as a tool for nursing practice and discusses some of the projects undertaken thus far.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

By use of logistic models (Rasch) the consistency of the {HDS} has been considered across patient-variables as age, sex, plasma levels of imipramine, and diagnosis. The results showed that the original 17-item {HDS} was without adequate consistency, i.e. the total score of the sample of items was no one-dimensional measure of depressive states. However, a melancholia subscale of the {HDS} contained items the total of which can be used to compare patients quantitatively, although in some part of the analysis one of these items showed ceiling effect. It was concluded that the melancholia sub-scale (containing the items depressed mood, guilt, work and interests, retardation, psychic anxiety, and general somatic symptoms) can form the basis for further improvements in the field of quantitative rating scales for depressive states.},

Studies have identified several temporal integration levels on different time scales which are fundamental for our understanding of behaviour and subjective experience. In recent literature concerning the philosophy and neuroscience of consciousness these separate temporal processing levels are not always precisely distinguished. Therefore, empirical evidence from psychophysics and neuropsychology on these distinct temporal processing levels is presented and discussed within philosophical conceptualizations of time experience. On an elementary level, one can identify a functional moment, a basic temporal building block of perception in the range of milliseconds that defines simultaneity and succession. Below a certain threshold temporal order is not perceived, individual events are processed as co-temporal. On a second level, an experienced moment, which is based on temporal integration of up to a few seconds, has been reported in many qualitatively different experiments in perception and action. It has been suggested that this segmental processing mechanism creates temporal windows that provide a logistical basis for conscious representation and the experience of nowness. On a third level of integration, continuity of experience is enabled by working-memory in the range of multiple seconds allowing the maintenance of cognitive operations and emotional feelings, leading to mental presence, a temporal window of an individual?s experienced presence.},

Autonomic activity (heart rate and skin conductance) was concurrently measured to determine whether pupillary changes are mediated by parasympathetic or sympathetic activation. Following an initial light reflex, pupillary changes were larger when viewing emotionally arousing pictures, regardless of whether these were pleasant or unpleasant. Pupillary changes during picture viewing covaried with skin conductance change, supporting the interpretation that sympathetic nervous system activity modulates these changes in the context of affective picture viewing. Taken together, the data provide strong support for the hypothesis that the pupil's response during affective picture viewing reflects emotional arousal associated with increased sympathetic activity.},

	volume = {31},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To develop a short, 4-item arthritis severity questionnaire that is simple to score, clinically useful and meaningful, and suitable for use in primary care, where osteoarthritis ({OA}) is the primary prevalent arthritis illness. {METHODS}: Data and items from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 ({SF}-36), the Western Ontario {McMaster} Osteoarthritis Index ({WOMAC}(c)), and visual analog scales ({VAS}) for pain and patient global severity were studied in 16,519 patients with arthritis. The Short Arthritis Assessment Scale ({SAS}) was developed by performing multivariable analyses that involved individually adding/subtracting items in differing regression models. The candidate items and scales were then studied by Rasch analysis, and tested for effect size, sensitivity to change, and reliability. The resultant scale was validated using data from a recent {OA} clinical trial. {RESULTS}: The {VAS} pain and {VAS} global severity scales and 2 items from the {WOMAC} in the {VAS} format, difficulty going down stairs and difficulty shopping, were found to be the best predictors of change in health status. The 4-item {SAS} was reliable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87), demonstrated good test-retest reliability (Lin's concordance coefficient = 0.85), was unidimensional, and was strongly correlated with other important clinical measures, indicating good construct validity. Using data from a recent randomized clinical trial in {OA}, the {SAS} performed better than the {WOMAC} pain scale and the {SF}-36 physical component score in detecting change, and at least as well as the clinical trial {VAS} pain scale. {CONCLUSION}: The {SAS} is a 4-item arthritis severity questionnaire that can be easily administered in primary care for patients with {OA}, but is suitable for use across all arthritis illnesses. Scoring is simple, requiring only the addition of four 10-point scales, and interpretation is straightforward. The {SAS} may have a role in rapid assessment of the arthritis patient in primary care practice.},

	volume = {35},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}In response to the need to support diverse and complex information requirements, nursing has developed a number of different terminology systems. The two main kinds of systems that have emerged are enumerative systems and combinatorial systems, although some systems have characteristics of both approaches. Differences in the structure and content of terminology systems, while useful at a local level, prevent effective wider communication, information sharing, integration of record systems, and comparison of nursing elements of healthcare information at a more global level. Formal nursing terminology systems present an alternative approach. This paper describes a number of recent initiatives and explains how these emerging approaches may help to augment existing nursing terminology systems and overcome their limitations through mediation. The development of formal nursing terminology systems is not an end in itself and there remains a great deal of work to be done before success can be claimed. This paper presents an overview of the key issues outstanding and provides recommendations for a way forward.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The {VF}-14 is intended to measure visual functioning based on sets of hierarchically structured items. Rasch item response theory ({IRT}) provides a methodology to examine the hierarchical structure and unidimensionality of a survey instrument. The purpose of this study is to examine the scale properties (hierarchical structure and unidimensionality) of the {VF}-14 using Rasch item response theory methodology in cataract patients (N = 80). The results of the study showed that the Korean version {VF}-14 is unidimensional with a hierarchy from easy to hard items, as well as being valid and reliable in the terms of traditional psychometric analysis. The Korean version of the {VF}-14 had some significant item spacings (three strata), and the rating-scale categories were worded well. Therefore, the Korean version of the {VF}-14 measures are appropriate for use in and further study of the visual limitations associated with cataract inpatients.

Although several questionnaires have been developed to measure mindfulness, the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire ({FFMQ}), [Baer et al., 2006. Using self-report assessment methods to explore facets of mindfulness. Assessment, 13, 27-45] is currently one of the most empirically-based scale assessing mindfulness.Objective The present study was designed to: (1) test the psychometric properties and (2) explore the structural validation of the French version of the {FFMQ}.Method Two hundred and fourteen participants were tested using the French version of the {FFMQ}.Results Using confirmatory factor analysis, the results showed the French version of the {FFMQ} has good psychometric properties and a structural validity similar to the initial version.Conclusion This adaptation constituted a validated mindfulness measure for French-speaking clinicians as well as researchers.},

Although activity level and age were significant factors, most of the activity level-by-age interaction in all but {DRT} was attributed to the slower performance of the {ONAs}. At least in this study, a life style of physical activity appeared to play a more dominant role in determining {SRT}, {DRT}, and {MT} than age.

Design: Prospective multi-centre cohort study. Patients: Patients receiving rehabilitation interventions for musculoskeletal, neurological or cardiopulmonary injury or disease in acute hospitals or early post-acute rehabilitation facilities. Methods: Functioning was coded using the {ICF}. For validation, absolute and relative frequencies (prevalences) of impairment, limitation or restriction were reported at admission and end-point (discharge or 6 weeks after admission). Aspects not covered were extracted and translated into the best corresponding {ICF} category. The criterion for selecting candidate categories for the brief {ICF} Core Sets was based on their ability to discriminate between patients with high or low functioning status. Discrimination was assessed using multivariable regression models, the independent variables being all of the {ICF} categories of the respective comprehensive {ICF} Core Set. Analogue ratings of overall functioning as reported by patients and health professionals were used as dependent variables. Conclusion: We present an algorithm to identify candidate categories for brief {ICF} Core Sets extracted from the comprehensive acute and post-acute {ICF} Core Sets.},

Seven experiments examined whether trait mindfulness--a disposition characterized by receptive attention to present experience--reduced defensive responses to mortality salience ({MS}). Under {MS}, less mindful individuals showed higher worldview defense (Studies 1-3) and self-esteem striving (Study 5), yet more mindful individuals did not defend a constellation of values theoretically associated with mindfulness (Study 4). To explain these findings through proximal defense processes, Study 6 showed that more mindful individuals wrote about their death for a longer period of time, which partially mediated the inverse association between trait mindfulness and worldview defense. Study 7 demonstrated that trait mindfulness predicted less suppression of death thoughts immediately following {MS}.

	abstract = {Confusion over the reporting and interpretation of results of commonly employed classical statistical tests is recorded in a sample of 1,645 papers from 12 psychology journals for the period 1990 through 2002. The confusion arises because researchers mistakenly believe that their interpretation is guided by a single unified theory of statistical inference. But this is not so: classical statistical testing is a nameless amalgamation of the rival and often contradictory approaches developed by Ronald Fisher, on the one hand, and Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, on the other. In particular, there is extensive failure to acknowledge the incompatibility of Fisher's evidential pvalue with the Type I error rate, *, of Neyman--Pearson statistical orthodoxy. The distinction between evidence (p's) and errors (*'s) is not trivial. Rather, it reveals the basic differences underlying Fisher's ideas on significance testing and inductive inference, and Neyman--Pearson views on hypothesis testing and inductive behavior. So complete is this misunderstanding over measures of evidence versus error that it is not viewed as even being a problem among the vast majority of researchers and other relevant parties. These include the {APA} Task Force on Statistical Inference, and those writing the guidelines concerning statistical testing mandated in {APA} Publication Manuals. The result is that, despite supplanting Fisher's significance-testing paradigm some fifty years or so ago, recognizable applications of Neyman--Pearson theory are few and far between in psychology's empirical literature. On the other hand, Fisher's influence is ubiquitous.},

A number of major revisions were made to the Beta 2 to develop the {ICNP} Version 1.0. Although the Beta 2 Version functioned to compare and combine data from different sources, there were many recommendations for improvement. In this paper, we examined the {ICNP} Version 1.0 and identified the changes from the Beta 2 Version. A major change was the use of new technology for development of the {ICNP} Version 1.0 using description logics. Another change to the new version is the single classification structure that was refined into representation of a 7 Axis Model. The new coding system and new guidelines for composing statements that were developed using an International Organization for Standardization ({ISO}) Standard are also discussed.},

For knee extension range of motion, the mean difference for the osteoarthritis group and non-osteoarthritis group was 4.9 degrees [95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.9 to 8.5] and 4.4 degrees (95\% {CI} 1.8 to 6.8), respectively. For peak passive torque, the mean difference in the osteoarthritis group and the non-osteoarthritis group was 4.4Nm (95\% {CI} 0.8 to 6.9) and 1.0Nm (95\% {CI} -1.4 to 3.5), respectively. For stiffness in the final 10\% of knee extension range of motion, the mean difference for the osteoarthritis group and the non-osteoarthritis group was 0.19Nm/degree (95\% {CI} 0.08 to 0.3) and 0.04Nm/degree (95\% {CI} -0.05 to 0.1), respectively. Stiffness in the final 10\% of knee extension range of motion was significantly higher in the osteoarthritis group compared with the non-osteoarthritis group after stretching. {CONCLUSIONS}: Elderly individuals with and without osteoarthritis of the knee are able to demonstrate immediate beneficial adaptations to a stretching intervention. This is important as stretching is often used in preparation for exercise programmes.},

	abstract = {The contribution into activities connected with the development of the quality of nursing care is closely combined with the process of systematic recording of accumulated data, of undertaken activities and achieved results. This in turn constitutes the essence of the 31st Aim of {WHO} which speaks not only about the need to continue the rational contribution towards the increase in the nursing care quality but also the application of adequate computer technologies to improve this quality. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the scope and character of the activities that have been over years undertaken by the nursing community towards the development of the classification systems which are comparable with those used in medicine. The focus has been specifically put on the taxonomy of diagnosis used by the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association ({NANDA}) and the European International Classification of Nursing Practice ({ICNP}). The analysis of the reference sources constitutes the methodological foundation applied in this work. It has allowed to show the pioneering contribution of the American Nursing Association ({ANA}) into the process of recording and coding of the data that are essential in care delivery as well as their value for the development of {ICNP}. The latter one is a systematic and multi-axial structure which uses unified terminology and numeric codes for the three categories of variables: the recognized conditions, the undertaken activities and the achieved results.},

Although sub stantive interpretations of these negative factors are usually attempted, this study demonstrates that the negative factor could be produced by a relatively small portion of the respondents who fail to attend to the negative-positive wording of the items. Data were generated using three different correlation matrices, which demonstrated that regardless of data source, when only 10\% of the respondents are careless in this fashion, a clearly definable negative factor is gener ated.

@article{Matrices2012,
	title = {Advanced Progressive Matrices},
	abstract = {Diagnostische Zielsetzung:Bei den Advanced Progressive Matrices ({APM}) handelt es sich um ein haeufig eingesetztes und bewaehrtes Verfahren zur Messung des sprachunabhaengigen logischen Denkens. Die {APM} gehoeren zur Verfahrensgruppe der Raven-Matrizen-Tests ({RPM}) und stellen in diesem Rahmen eine Version fuer ein ueberdurchschnittliches kognitives Leistungsniveau dar. Durch den Einsatz eines Zeitlimits kann die intellektuelle Effizienz der Probanden beurteilt werden.Aufbau:Die {APM}-Items bestehen aus geometrischen Figuren bzw. Mustern, in denen je ein Element ausgelassen wurde. Aus acht Antwortalternativen ist diejenige zu waehlen, die das Muster korrekt ergaenzt. Die Aufgaben sind nach Schwierigkeitsgrad geordnet und in zwei separaten Aufgabenheften zu den Aufgabensets 1 und 2 zusammengefasst. Das erste Set umfasst 12 Aufgaben ({APM} I), das zweite 36 Aufgaben ({APM} {II}). {APM} I wird entweder zur Vorbereitung des Einsatzes von {APM} {II} oder als Screeninginstrument eingesetzt. {APM} {II} ist lediglich bei Personen mit hinreichend hohem intellektuellen Leistungsniveau einzusetzen, um unnoetige Frustrationen zu vermeiden. Die gewaehlte Antwortalternative ist auf einem Durchschreibebogen bzw. in der computerisierten Version auf dem Monitor anzukreuzen.Grundlagen und Konstruktion:Die {APM} wurden 1943 zur Personalauslese im militaerischen Bereich eingesetzt und 1947 fuer den allgemeinen Gebrauch veroeffentlicht. Basierend auf Analysen der Aufgabenschwierigkeit wurden die Items nach ansteigender Schwierigkeit geordnet. Eine erste Revision der {APM} und eine Reduktion der urspruenglich 48 Items auf 36 Items ({APM} {II}) erfolgten 1962. In den aktuellen Auflagen des Verfahrens wurden die Items und ihre Reihenfolge nicht mehr modifiziert. Die mit den {RPM} gemessene Faehigkeit, Beziehungen zu stiften, wird von Raven als Faehigkeit beschrieben, aus vorgegebenen Informationen ein neues Verstaendnis bzw. neue Informationen abzuleiten.Empirische Prüfung und Gütekriterien:Aktuelle Manuale fuer die {APM} liegen von Raven et al. (1998b) sowie Heller et al. (1998) vor. Beide Manuale zitieren zahlreiche Studien, die mit den {APM} und den {RPM} als Verfahrensgruppe durchgefuehrt worden sind.Reliabilität: Die Reliabilitaetskoeffizienten fuer {APM} I fallen deutlich niedriger aus als fuer {APM} {II}. Als Masse der internen Konsistenz ermittelten Raven et al. (1998b, S. 24) fuer die {APM} {II} Split-half-Reliabilitaetskoeffizienten zwischen .83 und .87, fuer {APM} I Werte um .73. Heller et al. (1998, S. 12) ermittelten Alphawerte zwischen .34 und .78 ({APM} I) sowie zwischen .70 und .88 ({APM} {II}; Schueler der Klassen 6 bis 12). Nach einem Intervall von 3 Monaten ermittelten Heller et al. (1998, S. 13) an Schuelerstichproben Retestreliabilitaetskoeffizienten zwischen .58 und .82.Validität: Verwiesen wird auf signifikante Korrelationen zwischen {APM} und anderen Verfahren zur Messung intellektueller Faehigkeiten. Die Korrelationen mit sprachfreien Verfahren (z.B. Wechsler-Handlungs-{IQ}: r = .55) liegen ueber denen mit sprachbezogenen Verfahren (z.B. Wechsler-Verbal-{IQ}: r = .42; 131 Schueler). Korrelationen zwischen {APM} und den quantitativen und nonverbalen Skalen des Kognitiven Faehigkeitstests (.26 bis .44) bestaetigen insbesondere die Komponente des analogen Denkens in den {APM} (98 hochbegabte Schueler der 9./10. Klasse Gymnasium; 59 Schueler der 10. Klasse Regelgymnasium). Mit der beim Zahlenverbindungstest zentralen Komponente der Informationsverarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit weisen die {APM} zwar signifikante, aber nicht sehr hohe Zusammenhaenge von .34 ({APM} I) bzw. .33 ({APM} {II}) auf (114 Schueler der 8./9. Klasse). Mit den Mathematikschulnoten der 8. bzw. 9. Klasse (223 Schueler) bzw. den Deutschnoten wiesen die {APM} Korrelationen in Hoehe von .34 ({APM} I) und .35({APM} {II}) bzw. .23 ({APM} I) und .27 ({APM} {II}) auf. Hinweise auf eine Geschlechtsabhaengigkeit der {APM}-Ergebnisse liegen nicht vor.Normen: Die deutschen Referenzwerte (Prozentraenge) von Raven et al. (1998b) basieren auf einer Stichprobe von 1142 Personen (48.5\% weiblich, 51,5\% maennlich; 13-75 Jahre). Ein vorhandenes Zeitlimit sowie unterschiedliche Bildungsniveaus und Berufsgruppen werden beruecksichtigt. Die Normen der {APM}-Ausgabe von Heller et al. (1998) beruhen auf einer deutschsprachigen Stichprobe von 581 Studierenden, 921 Schuelern und 157 Senioren ueber 60 Jahren. Ferner werden Daten von Normierungsstichproben aus Australien, China, Deutschland, Grossbritannien, Neuseeland, Nordirland, Polen sowie den {USA} aufgefuehrt.},

Using a sample of 188 young adults who forecasted their emotions for the weeks following the 2008 Presidential election, we tested our prediction that facets of mindfulness would decrease the impact bias, a well-known error in affective forecasting. Mindfulness was measured with the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, \& Toney, 2006). One facet of mindfulness, observing one's internal state, was associated with more moderate affective forecasts as well as a decreased susceptibility to the impact bias. Findings highlight sources of individual differences in susceptibility to the impact bias and shed light on how to improve people's ability to forecast for emotional experiences.},

3,900 general acute care hospitals (about 90\% of all such United
States hospitals). The authors highlight the opportunities afforded
by this publicly reported data on hospital inpatients' experiences
and perceptions of care. These data, reported on www.hospitalcompare.hhs.

of hospital care and can be used alone or in conjunction with other
clinical and outcome measures. Potential benefits include increased
transparency, improved consumer decision making, and increased incentives

Traditionally, spirituality was used to describe the deeply religious person, but it has now expanded to include the superficially religious person, the religious seeker, the seeker of well-being and happiness, and the completely secular person. Instruments used to measure spirituality reflect this trend. These measures are heavily contaminated with questions assessing positive character traits or mental health: optimism, forgiveness, gratitude, meaning and purpose in life, peacefulness, harmony, and general well-being. Spirituality, measured by indicators of good mental health, is found to be correlated with good mental health. This research has been reported in some of the world's top medical journals. Such associations are meaningless and tautological. Either spirituality should be defined and measured in traditional terms as a unique, uncontaminated construct, or it should be eliminated from use in academic research.

	abstract = {It has long been known that pupils - the apertures that allow light into the eyes - dilate and constrict not only in response to changes in ambient light but also in response to emotional changes and arousing stimuli (e.g., Fontana, 1765). Charles Darwin (1872) related changes in pupil diameter to fear and other �emotions� in animals. For decades, pupillometry has been used to study cognitive processing across many domains, including perception, language, visual search, and short-term memory. Historically, such studies have examined the pupillary reflex as a correlate of attentional demands imposed by different tasks or stimuli - pupils typically dilate as cognitive demand increases. Because the neural mechanisms responsible for such task-evoked pupillary reflexes ({TEPRs}) implicate a role for memory processes, recent studies have examined pupillometry as a tool for investigating the cognitive processes underlying the creation of new episodic memories and their later retrieval. Here, we review the historical antecedents of current pupillometric research and discuss several recent studies linking pupillary dilation to the on-line consumption of cognitive resources in long-term-memory tasks. We conclude by discussing the future role of pupillometry in memory research and several methodological considerations that are important when designing pupillometric studies.},

Of 147 unique nursing intervention statements extracted, 136 (92.52\%) could be mapped into {NIC} and 99 (67.35\%) statements could be completely mapped into {ICNP}. Using mapping methodology, this study validates that both {NIC} and {ICNP} would be useful for documenting nursing care in a Korean hospital, but it also identifies additional concepts that need to be represented in both of these standardized nursing languages. It is recommended that nurses be more careful in documenting their interventions and also that {SNLs} be developed further to more completely represent nursing practice.},

South Africa had two research groups. One of the research groups identified the term informal settlement to define. {METHODS} This was a qualitative study where a philosophical perspective was used to explore, explain and describe nursing practice. The combined method proposed by the {ICN} was utilized to define and validate the term informal settlement. {FINDINGS} Validation and literature review provided sufficient support for the defined characteristics and the term was finally defined and submitted to {ICN} on 12 April 2001 as informal settlement is a type of residential development with the specific characteristics--temporary residential structures, erected with limited or no formal infrastructure, densely populated, no secure tenure for occupants, no property demarcations, often associated with overcrowding/limited or no privacy, and low standard of living, being situated in high risk areas with an increased risk for disease and disasters. {CONCLUSION} The {ICNP} Evaluation Committee recommended inclusion in the {ICNP} with minor changes in February 2003.},

There was an inverse relationship between {MMSE} scores and age, ranging from a median of 29 for those 18 to 24 years of age, to 25 for individuals 80 years of age and older. The median {MMSE} score was 29 for individuals with at least 9 years of schooling, 26 for those with 5 to 8 years of schooling, and 22 for those with 0 to 4 years of schooling. {CONCLUSIONS} Cognitive performance as measured by the {MMSE} varies within the population by age and education. The cause of this variation has yet to be determined. Mini-Mental State Examination scores should be used to identify current cognitive difficulties and not to make formal diagnoses. The results presented should prove to be useful to clinicians who wish to compare an individual patient's {MMSE} scores with a population reference group and to researchers making plans for new studies in which cognitive status is a variable of interest.},

To fill this gap, the Game Engagement Questionnaire ({GEQ}) was developed using both classical and Rasch analyses. In Study 1 Rasch analyses provide support for the reliability and functionality of the {GEQ} scores. Rasch analyses also demonstrate that the {GEQ} has adequate separation, fit, rating scale functioning, and dimensionality, suggesting that one's tendency to become engaged in video game-playing is a quantifiable construct. In Study 2, behavioral and questionnaire data supported the reliability and validity of the {GEQ} for predicting engagement in violent video games. The {GEQ} provides a psychometrically strong measure of levels of engagement specifically elicited while playing video games, and thus shows promise for future research examining risk and protective factors for negative game impact.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The root mean square of the {EMG} activity was determined from four 4-s samples taken at 30-s intervals, during 2 min of standing in each of five positions of simulated {KFC} (0 degree, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees and 40 degrees). A randomly balanced order of conditions was used. {KFC} were simulated in each subject by means of an adjustable line from the subject's waist to the sole of each foot. An analysis of variance was used to contrast {EMG} activity, and a significant difference was found between each of the positions (P less than 0.05). The mean (+/- 1 {SD}) {EMG} activity, expressed as a percentage of the maximum voluntary contraction, was 0.3\% (+/- 0.2) at 0 degree, 7.6\% (+/- 5.6) at 10 degrees, 10.9\% (+/- 7.6) at 20 degrees, 16.6\% (+/- 12.4) at 30 degrees and 24.0\% (+/- 14.0) at 40 degrees. A linear relationship was found (r2 = 0.986), expressed by the equation y = 0.62 + 0.56 x, where y represents {EMG} activity and x represents the extent of simulated {KFC} (P = 0.0007). The results provide insight into the increased knee extensor activity necessary to stand with {KFC} and underline the importance of treating this common disorder.},

	abstract = {Measurement, the means by which numbers enter science, is of fundamental importance to modern science. The relationship between its qualitative and quantitative aspects has generated many theories and much controversy. In 19th century geometry similar developments led mathematician Felix Klein to devise a theory for unifying qualitative and quantitative approaches to geometry. Klein's theory, which today is called the Erlanger program, was based on transformation groups. In this article, the Erlanger program is given a new foundation based on mathematical logic and is extended to science. The current dominant theory of measurement in the literature, the representational theory, is then justified in terms of the new foundation for the Erlanger program. Certain inferential techniques used in dimensional analysis and the related technique of possible psychophysical laws are also given justifications in terms of the new foundation.},

Four hypotheses were tested with data from 12 public health nurses in school settings and 220 schoolchildren. Group A comprised six nurses who used {SNAP} Health Center ({SNAP} 98) software to record health visits with 117 children. Group B comprised six nurses who used the same software and {NANDA}, {NIC}, and {NOC} with 103 children. After use of the software, the power of the 12 nurses to help children significantly increased. For the 220 children, the number of coping strategies significantly increased but there were no changes in the other health outcomes. The hypotheses indicating that Group B nurses and children would have more positive changes than Group A were not supported. Positive and negative elements for large-scale studies were identified.

Assessments were performed in a biomechanics laboratory. {PARTICIPANTS}: Forty healthy volunteers (mean age +/- {SD}, 72.1+/-4.7 y) randomized to 2 groups: intervention (n=20) and control (n=20). {INTERVENTION}: Intervention participants performed an 8-week stretching program, and control group participants maintained activity level for 8 weeks. One investigator made weekly visits to instruct and monitor participants. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Primary outcome measures were passive joint motion for hip extension and ankle dorsiflexion and freely chosen gait speed. Secondary outcome measures were gait parameters during freely chosen gait speed and set gait speed walking (stride length, joint displacement). {RESULTS}: Compared with the control group, the intervention group had increased combined hip and knee motion (P=.023), ankle motion (P=.020), and freely chosen gait speed (P=.016). The intervention group showed statistically nonsignificant trends of increased stride length at freely chosen gait speed and set gait speed. {CONCLUSIONS}: Findings suggest joint motion is a modifiable impairment that is effectively targeted with flexibility training for older people. Participants in the intervention group had improvements in joint motion as well as increased freely chosen gait speed. Mechanisms responsible for changes in freely chosen gait speed warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {Honey bees provide a model system to elucidate the relationship between sociality and complex behaviors within the same species, as females (workers) are highly social and males (drones) are more solitary. We report on aversive learning studies in drone and worker honey bees (Apis mellifera anatolica) in escape, punishment and discriminative punishment situations. In all three experiments, a newly developed electric shock avoidance assay was used. The comparisons of expected and observed responses were performed with conventional statistical methods and a systematic randomization modeling approach called object oriented modeling. The escape experiment consisted of two measurements recorded in a master--yoked paradigm: frequency of response and latency to respond following administration of shock. Master individuals could terminate an unavoidable shock triggered by a decrementing 30 s timer by crossing the shuttlebox centerline following shock activation. Across all groups, there was large individual response variation. When assessing group response frequency and latency, master subjects performed better than yoked subjects for both workers and drones. In the punishment experiment, individuals were shocked upon entering the shock portion of a bilaterally wired shuttlebox. The shock portion was spatially static and unsignalled. Only workers effectively avoided the shock. The discriminative punishment experiment repeated the punishment experiment but included a counterbalanced blue and yellow background signal and the side of shock was manipulated. Drones correctly responded less than workers when shock was paired with blue. However, when shock was paired with yellow there was no observable difference between drones and workers.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Stretching protocols for elderly people ({\textgreater} or = 65 years of age) have not been studied to determine the effectiveness of increasing range of motion ({ROM}). The purpose of this study was to determine which of 3 durations of stretches would produce and maintain the greatest gains in knee extension {ROM} with the femur held at 90 degrees of hip flexion in a group of elderly individuals. {SUBJECTS}: Sixty-two subjects (mean age = 84.7 years, {SD} = 5.6, range = 65-97) with tight hamstring muscles (defined as the inability to extend the knee to less than 20 degrees of knee flexion) participated. Subjects were recruited from a retirement housing complex and were independent in activities of daily living. {METHODS}: Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups and completed a physical activity questionnaire. The subjects in group 1 (n = 13, mean age = 85.1 years, {SD} = 6.4, range = 70-97), a control group, performed no stretching. The randomly selected right or left limb of subjects in group 2 (n = 17, mean age = 85.5 years, {SD} = 4.5, range = 80-93), group 3 (n = 15, mean age = 85.2 years, {SD} = 6.5, range = 65-92), and group 4 (n = 17, mean age = 83.2 years, {SD} = 4.6, range = 68-90) was stretched 5 times per week for 6 weeks for 15, 30, and 60 seconds, respectively. Range of motion was measured once a week for 10 weeks to determine the treatment and residual effects. Data were analyzed using a growth curve model. {RESULTS}: A 60-second stretch produced a greater rate of gains in {ROM} (60-second stretch = 2.4 degrees per week, 30-second stretch = 1.3 degrees per week, 15-second stretch = 0.6 degrees per week), which persisted longer than the gains in any other group (group 4 still had 5.4 degrees more {ROM} 4 weeks after treatment than at pretest as compared with 0.7 degrees and 0.8 degrees for groups 2 and 3, respectively). {DISCUSSION} {AND} {CONCLUSION}: Longer hold times during stretching of the hamstring muscles resulted in a greater rate of gains in {ROM} and a more sustained increase in {ROM} in elderly subjects. These results may differ from those of studies performed with younger populations because of age-related physiologic changes.},

	abstract = {Although the relationship between strength and physical performance in older adults is probably non-linear, few empirical studies have demonstrated that this is so. In a population-based sample of adults aged 60-96 years (n = 409), leg strength was measured in four muscle groups (knee extensor, knee flexor, ankle plantar flexor, ankle dorsiflexor) of both legs using an isokinetic dynamometer. A leg strength score was calculated as the sum of the four strength measurements in the right leg. Usual gait speed was measured over a 15.2 metre course. With a linear model, leg strength explained 17\% of the variance in gait speed. Non-linear models (quadratic and inverse) explained significantly more variance (22\%). The nature of the non-linear relationship was that, in stronger subjects, there was no association between strength and gait speed, while in weaker subjects, there was an association. Body weight and age also explained significant amounts of variance in gait speed, while sex and height did not. The results supported the hypothesis of a non-linear relationship between leg strength and gait speed that is similar for older men and women. This finding represents a mechanism for how small changes in physiological capacity may have substantial effects on performance in frail adults, while large changes in capacity have little or no effect in healthy adults.},

	abstract = {Abstract The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of implementing a new 8-week mindfulness-based programme, `Mindfulness-Based Coping with University Life' ({MBCUL}), specifically tailored to the needs and demand of students and to explore its impact in a pilot evaluation. Participants were drawn from the University of Northampton ({MBCUL} N = 10; control N = 6). A non-randomized wait-list-controlled design was employed. Measures examined anxiety and depression, perceived stress, mindfulness and personally relevant change before and immediately after the programme. The diurnal profile of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase level was collected for two consecutive days. No significant intergroup differences were observed on any of the measures at either time point. However, significant change was observed for the {MBCUL} group in terms of perceived stress (d = 1.06; z = −2.25, p = 0.03), anxiety (d = 1.04; z = −2.14, p = 0.03), depression (d = 0.52; z = −0.69, p = 0.5) and personally relevant change (d = 2.63; z = −2.68, p = 0.01), along with an increase in mindfulness (d = 1.06; z = −1.89, p = 0.06). In contrast, no significant change was found in the daily profiles of cortisol and alpha-amylase. The data from this pilot tentatively suggest that {MBCUL} appears to be a promising programme that warrants further evaluation using a randomized study with a larger sample size.

Study participants: European Pathway Association (E-P-A) contact persons in 23 countries. Results: Clinical pathways, also known as critical pathways or integrated care pathways, have been used in health care for 20 years. Although clinical pathways are well established, little information exists on their use and dissemination around the world. The E-P-A has performed their first international survey on the use and dissemination of clinical pathways in 23 countries. At present, pathways are used with a minority of patients, mainly in acute hospital trusts. Our survey showed that clinical pathways were predominantly viewed as a ultidisciplinary tool to improve the quality and efficiency of evidence-based care. Pathways were also used as a communication tool between professionals to manage and standardize outcome-oriented care. Conclusions: There is a future for the use of clinical pathways, but there is a need for international benchmarking and knowledge sharing with regard to their development, implementation and evaluation.},

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:The recovery of patients after an acute episode of illness or injury depends both on adequate medical treatment and on the early identification of needs for rehabilitation care. The process of early beginning rehabilitation requires efficient communication both between health professionals and the patient in order to effectively address all rehabilitation goals. The currently used nursing taxonomies, however, are not intended for interdisciplinary use and thus may not contribute to efficient rehabilitation management and an optimal patient outcome. The {ICF} might be the missing link in this communication process. The objective of this study was to identify the categories of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health ({ICF}) categories relevant for nursing care in the situation of acute and early post-acute rehabilitation.{METHODS}:First, in a consensus process, "Leistungserfassung in der Pflege" ({LEP}) nursing interventions relevant for the situation of acute and early post-acute rehabilitation were selected. Second, in an integrated two-step linking process, two nursing experts derived goals of {LEP} nursing interventions from their practical knowledge and selected corresponding {ICF} categories most relevant for patients in acute and post-acute rehabilitation ({ICF} Core Sets).{RESULTS}:Eighty-seven percent of {ICF} Core Set categories could be linked to goals of at least one nursing intervention variable of {LEP}. The {ICF} categories most frequently linked with {LEP} nursing interventions were respiration functions, experience of self and time functions and focusing attention. Thirteen percent of {ICF} Core Set categories could not be linked with {LEP} nursing interventions. The {LEP} nursing interventions which were linked with the highest number of different {ICF}-categories of all were "therapeutic intervention", "patient-nurse communication/information giving" and "mobilising".{CONCLUSION}:The {ICF} Core Sets for the acute hospital and early post-acute rehabilitation facilities are highly relevant for rehabilitation nursing. Linking nursing interventions with {ICF} Core Set categories is a feasible way to analyse nursing. Using the {ICF} Core Sets to describe goals of nursing interventions both facilitates inter-professional communication and respects patient's needs. The {ICF} may thus be a useful framework to set nursing intervention goals.},

	title = {Chapter 3: The problem of scale},
	abstract = {Exploratory data analysis is detective work--numerical detective work--or counting detective work--or graphical detective work. A detective investigating a crime needs both tools and under-standing. If he has no fingerprint powder, he will fail to find fingerprints on most surfaces. If he does not understand where the criminal is likely to have put his fingers, he will will not look in the right places. Equally, the analyst of data needs both tools and understanding (p 1: Tukey (1977)) As discussed in Chapter 1 the challenge of psychometrics is assign numbers to observations in a way that best summarizes the underlying constructs. The ways to collect observations are multiple and can be based upon comparisons of order or of proximity (Chapter 2). But given a set of observations, how best to describe them? This is a problem not just for observational but also for experimental psychologists for both approaches are attempting to make inferences about latent variables in terms of statistics based upon observed variables (Figure 3.1). For the experimentalist, the problem becomes interpreting the effect of an experimental manipulation upon some outcome variable (path B in Figure 3.1 in terms of the effect of manipulation on the latent outcome variable (path b) and the relationship between the latent and observed outcome variables (path s). For the observationalist, the observed correlation between the observed Person Variable and Outcome variable (path A) is interpreted as a function of the relationship between the latent person trait variable and the observed trait variable (path r), the latent outcome variable and the observed outcome variable (path s), and most importantly for inference, the relationship between the two latent variables (path a). Paths r and s are influenced by the reliability (Chapter 7), the validity (Chapter 9) and the shape of the functions r and s mapping the latents to the observed variables. The problem of measurement is a question about the shape of these relationships. But before it is possible to discuss shape it is necessary to consider the kinds of relationships that are possible. This requires a consideration of how to assign numbers to the data. Consider the set of observations organized into a data.frame, s.df, in Table 3.1. Copy this table into the clipboard, and read the clipboard into the data.frame, s.df. 1 A data.frame is an essential element in R and has many (but not all) the properties of a matrix. Unlike a matrix, the column entries can be of different data types (strings, logical, integer, or numeric). Data.frames have dimensions (the number of rows and columns), and a structure. To see the structure of a data.frame (or any other R object, use the str function. 1 Because  is read as X., we add the command colnames(s.df)[4] {\textless}-"theta" to match the table.},

Nursing care plans can be broadly based on {NANDA}-I taxonomies. No published attempt has been made to systematically compare the {NANDA}-I Taxonomy {II} to the {ICF}. {DATA} {SOURCES} The most recently published descriptions of both classifications and a case example presenting the combined use of both classifications. The work was carried out in 2009. {DISCUSSION} There are conceptual commonalities and differences between the {ICF} and the {NANDA}-I Taxonomy {II}. In the case example, the overlap between the {ICF} categories and {NANDA}-I nursing diagnoses reflects the fact that the {ICF}, focusing on functioning and disability, and the {NANDA}-I Taxonomy {II}, with its functioning health patterns, are similar in their approaches. {IMPLICATIONS} {FOR} {NURSING} The {NANDA}-I Taxonomy {II} permits the fulfilment of requirements that are exclusively nursing issues. The application of the {ICF} is useful for nurses to communicate nursing issues with other healthcare professionals in a common language. For nurses, knowledge shared with other healthcare professionals may contribute to broader understanding of a patient's situation. {CONCLUSION} The {ICF} and the {NANDA}-I Taxonomy {II} should be used in concert by nurses and can complement each other to enhance the quality of clinical team work and nursing practice.},

Additional statistics are required to describe the joint distribution of two or more variables. The covariance provides a natural measure of the association between two variables, and it appears in the analysis of many problems in quantitative genetics including the resemblance between relatives, the correlation between characters, and measures of selection. As a prelude to the formal theory of covariance and regression, we first pro- vide a brief review of the theory for the distribution of pairs of random variables. We then give a formal definition of the covariance and its properties. Next, we show how the covariance enters naturally into statistical methods for estimating the linear relationship between two variables (least-squares linear regression) and for estimating the goodness-of-fit of such linear trends (correlation). Finally, we apply the concept of covariance to several problems in quantitative-genetic the- ory. More advanced topics associated with multiv},

A statistically significant correlation was observed between dominant shoulder internal rotation deficits and shoulder pain. Also observed was a statistically significant correlation between lead hip internal rotation deficits and lumbar extension deficits with {LBP}. We conclude that due to repetitive demands on the dominant shoulder and repetitive pivoting at the lead hip, the cycle of microtrauma and scar formation leads to capsular contracture and subsequent reduction in internal range of motion. It is likely that the limitation in lumbar extension in the symptomatic group is not only due to decreased flexibility from an increased load on the spine, but also due to a protective mechanism to prevent further exacerbation of the {LBP}. Physical conditioning that includes shoulder as well as hip internal rotation stretching programs should therefore be essential aspects in the treatment of tennis players with shoulder pain and {LBP} respectively.},

``fair��? (\$κ\$ 0.2--0.4) for 6 questions and ``poor��? (\$κ\$ 0.1--0.2)
for 5 questions. Scores correlated well with the Client Satisfaction
Questionnaire (Spearman's r = 0.75, p{\textless}0.001). 843 patients
(57\% of those eligible) from five intermediate-care schemes took
part in phase {III}. Principal components analysis suggested six factors
or subscales: general satisfaction, affective response, cognitive
response, timing of discharge, coordination after discharge, and
access to pain relief, although the last three factors comprised
only one question each. The intraclass correlation coefficients in
the first three subscales varied from 0.82 to 0.89. Scores for all
subscales differed by scheme, suggesting construct validity. Only
one question (on general satisfaction) was found to be redundant.Conclusion:
The questionnaire, with some minor amendments to improve performance,
could be used as a validated tool for audit and research in intermediate
care. An amended version and scoring programme is available from
us on request.},

	volume = {71},
	abstract = {Objective: To investigate pain perception and the potential analgesic
effects of mindful states in experienced Zen meditators.Methods:
Highly trained Zen meditators (n = 13; {\textgreater}1000 hours of practice) and
age/gender-matched control volunteers (n = 13) received individually
adjusted thermal stimuli to elicit moderate pain on the calf. Conditions
included: a) baseline-1: no task; b) concentration: attend exclusively
to the calf; c) mindfulness: attend to the calf and observe, moment
to moment, in a nonjudgmental manner; and d) baseline-2: no task.Results:
Meditators required significantly higher temperatures to elicit moderate
pain (meditators: 49.9\$ {\textasciicircum}∘\$C; controls: 48.2\$ {\textasciicircum}∘\$C; p = .01). While attending
``mindfully,��? meditators reported decreases in pain intensity
whereas control subjects showed no change from baseline. The concentration
condition resulted in increased pain intensity for controls but not
for meditators. Changes in pain unpleasantness generally paralleled
those found in pain intensity. In meditators, pain modulation correlated
with slowing of the respiratory rate and with greater meditation
experience. Covariance analyses indicated that mindfulness-related
changes could be partially explained by changes in respiratory rates.
Finally, the meditators reported higher tendencies to observe and
be nonreactive of their own experience as measured on the Five Factor
Mindfulness Questionnaire; these factors correlated with individual
differences in respiration.Conclusions: These results indicated that
Zen meditators have lower pain sensitivity and experience analgesic
effects during mindful states. Results may reflect cognitive/self-regulatory
skills related to the concept of mindfulness and/or altered respiratory
patterns. Prospective studies investigating the effects of meditative
training and respiration on pain regulation are warranted.},

	abstract = {A new method is presented for performing rapid and accurate numerical estimation. The method is derived from an area of human cognitive psychology called preattentive process-ing. Preattentive processing refers to an initial organization of the visual field based on cognitive operations believed to be rapid, automatic, and spatially parallel. Examples of visual features that can be detected in this way include hue, intensity, orientation, size, and motion. We believe that studies from preattentive vision should be used to assist in the de-sign of visualization tools, especially those for which high speed target detection, boundary identification, and region detection are important. In our present study, we investigated two known preattentive features (hue and orientation) in the context of a new task (numerical estimation) in order to see whether preattentive estimation was possible. Our experiments tested displays that were designed to visualize data from salmon migration simulations. The results showed that rapid and accurate estimation was indeed possible using either hue or orientation. Furthermore, random variation in one of these features resulted in no inter-ference when subjects estimated the percentage of the other. To test the generality of our results, we varied two important display parameters, display duration and feature differ-ence, and found boundary conditions for each. Implications of our results for application to real-word data and tasks are discussed.},

	abstract = {This study compared the efficacy of 4 different hamstring-stretching techniques. Flexibility can be achieved by a variety of stretching techniques, yet little research has been performed on the most effective method. The 2 basic types include active stretching, in which range of motion is increased through voluntary contraction, and passive stretching, in which range of motion is increased through external assistance. The 2 types of active stretching include neuromobilization and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation ({PNF}). Our study aims to determine which type of stretching technique is most effective in improving hamstring length. One hundred subjects between the ages of 21 and 57 were enrolled in the study. Intrarater reliability of hamstring length measurement was performed using 10 subjects. All 100 subjects were included in a randomized controlled trial of 5 different groups comparing different hamstring-stretching techniques. Outcome measures, including hamstring length and perceived level of hamstring tightness, were recorded on all subjects initially, at 4 weeks, and at 8 weeks. After 4 weeks of stretching, there was a statistically significant improvement in hamstring length (p {\textless} 0.05) using active stretches as compared with passive stretches. From weeks 4 through 8, hamstring length for the active stretching groups decreased. After 8 weeks of stretching, the straight leg raise ({SLR}) passive stretch group had the greatest improvement in hamstring length. There was no correlation between hamstring flexibility and age, initial tightness, or frequency of exercise per week. Improvement in hamstring flexibility was greatest for the {SLR} passive stretch. Also, using {PNF} in the 90/90 active stretch provided better knee range-of-motion improvements than the 90/90 passive methods did.},

The effect of {pH} on a pcm mutant during long-term stationary phase was examined. {PCM} was not required for long-term survival of E. coli subjected to {pH} stress alone; however, {PCM}-deficient cells showed impaired resistance to paraquat and methanol only at elevated {pH}. The mutant also showed stress-survival phenotypes in minimal medium buffered to {pH} 9.0. Accumulation of isoaspartyl residues was accelerated at {pH} 8.0 or 9.0 in vivo, though {PCM}-deficient cells did not show higher levels of damage. However, the pcm mutant displayed an extended lag phase in recovering from stationary phase at {pH} 9.0. Protein repair by {PCM} thus plays a key role in long-term stress survival only at alkaline {pH} in E. coli, and it may function primarily to repair damage in cells that are recovering from nutrient limitation and in those cells that are able to divide during long-term stationary phase.},

	abstract = {We contend that generalizability (G) theory allows design of psychometric approaches to testing English-language learners ({EELs}) that are consistent with current thinking in linguistics. We used G theory to estimate the amount of measurement error due to code (language or dialect). Fourth - and fifth-grade {ELLs}, native speakers of Haitian-Creole from two speech communities, were given the same set of mathematics items in the standard English and standard Haitian-Creole dialects (Sample 1) or in the standard and local dialects of Haitian-Creole (Samples 2 and 3). The largest measurement error observed was produced by the interaction of student, item and code. Our results indicate that the reliability and dependability of {ELL} achievement measures is affected by two facts that operate in combination: Each test item poses a unique set of linguistic challenges and each student has a unique set of linguistic strengths and weaknesses. This sensitivity to language appears to take place at the level of dialect. Also, students from different speech communities within the same broad linguistic group may differ considerably in the number of items needed to obtain dependable measures of their academic achievement. Whether students are tested in English or in their first language, dialect variation needs to be considered if language as a source of measurement error is to be effectively addressed.},

Seeking to achieve a more realistic simulation of actual courtroom practice than that produced in prior studies, which have relied exclusively on short written synopses as their method of trial presentation, this experiment tested the hypothesis that physical attractiveness would have a significant impact on juridic judgments even though the audiovisual presentation of the trial permitted the introduction of a variety of the important stimuli typically present at a jury trial. This prediction received empirical support: Subjects exposed to an attractive plaintiff and an unattractive defendant more often found in favor of the plaintiff and awarded more money in damages than students viewing an unattractive plaintiff and an attractive defendant. However in contrast to findings from general studies of interpersonal evaluation, analyses of student perceptions of the two litigants provided only limited evidence for a global (positive) physical attractiveness stereotype within the context of a simulated trial. Instead, the observed effect of physical attractiveness on student decisions was apparently mediated by differential perceptions of the seriousness of the accident itself. Possible implications of the results for the judicial process were mentioned.},

The {CAR} was assessed on 3 days pre- and 3 days post-{MBSR} as a biological marker of stress.Results A significant effect on the {CAR} was found, with cortisol levels showing a prolonged increase after awakening at the post-{MBSR} assessment period. This was accompanied by significant improvements in self-reported stress levels, depressive symptomatology, and medical symptoms. Furthermore, the change in medical symptoms was negatively correlated with the area under the curve ({AUC}) at study onset (r = -.52, p {\textless} .002); i.e., the greater the {AUC} of the {CAR} before {MBSR}, the greater the reduction in medical symptoms after the program.Conclusions These results suggest the potential usefulness of employing the {CAR} as a biological marker in women with breast cancer participating in an {MBSR} program.},

	volume = {12},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{OBJECTIVES} The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health ({ICF}) provides a comprehensive and universally accepted framework to classify changes in functioning related to health conditions. Comprehensive and Brief Core Sets have been defined for various disorders but not for sleep disorders. Such a Core Set would greatly enhance the techniques available to describe the impact of sleep disorders on patients. The overarching purpose of this paper is to report on phase 1 of the international and World Health Organization ({WHO}) endorsed consensus process in identifying {ICF} Core Sets for sleep disorders. {METHODS} A formal decision-making and consensus process which integrated evidence gathered from preparatory studies was carried out. Relevant {ICF} categories were selected by a sample of international experts from different backgrounds using the nominal group technique. {RESULTS} Twenty-six experts from 22 countries and different professional backgrounds attended the consensus conference. Altogether 120 second- or third-level {ICF} categories were included in the Comprehensive {ICF} Core Set with the following {ICF} component split: 49 categories from body functions, 8 from body structures, 31 from activities and participation and 32 from environmental factors. The Brief {ICF} Core Set included a total of 15 second-level categories: 5 body functions (sleep, energy and drive, attention, consciousness, respiration functions); 3 body structures (brain, respiratory system, pharynx); 4 activities and participation (focusing attention, driving, handling stress and other psychological demands, carrying out daily routine); and 3 environmental factors (immediate family; health services, systems, and policies; and health professionals). {CONCLUSION} A formal consensus process integrating evidence and expert opinion led to the first version of the {ICF} Core Sets for persons with sleep disorders. Further validation of the Core Set is needed.},

This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of data sets of nursing practice, and the differences and similarities of five national and international {NMDS} systems. The purpose is to apply this information toward an {NMDS} initiative in the Netherlands. Future initiatives in {NMDS} development should include international coordination.},

In study 1 adult females (n = 196; mean age = 21 yrs) completed the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire ({TEFQ}-R21), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a measure of dispositional mindfulness. In study 2 adult females (n = 190; mean age = 26 yrs) completed the same measures as in study 1 with the addition of the Barratt Impulsivity Scale. In both studies it was predicted that mindfulness would be negatively related to trait disinhibition controlling for adverse psychological symptoms. The second study addressed the additional hypothesis that the relationship between mindfulness and trait disinhibition would be mediated by impulsivity. Regression analyses indicated that mindfulness was negatively related to and explained 11\% of variation in trait disinhibition (study 1). This relationship was replicated and extended in study 2 whereby impulsivity mediated the relationship between mindfulness and trait disinhibition. The findings warrant experimental and in vivo investigations of the potential causal relationships between mindfulness, impulsivity and eating behaviours.},

Method. In light of the {MSK} conditions as classified in the {ICD}, categories from existing {ICF} core sets for {MSK} conditions were pooled to specify functioning. Another approach was to consider other categories from measures or instruments already linked in the literature. Results. {ICF} Categories have been pooled from six core sets for {MSK} conditions, two specific care settings, one {MSK} clinical trial setting and eight instrument linkage papers. Conclusions. The {ICD}--{ICF} joint use would be able to capture the impact of a health condition by taking into account the disease and functioning status which would facilitate clinical care. Therefore, there is reasonable ground to demonstrate the operational linkage and complementary role of the {ICD} and the {ICF} in the context of the {ICD} revision.},

In a previous study, we have extended the {ICNP} concept model to support representation of nursing assessment data.

The semantics represented by the {ICNP} were completely related to the {RIM} implying that the {ICNP} is a good candidate terminology to encode the data with in an electronic documentation system. A few differences between the two models in representing the same semantics suggests that there is value to supporting broad ranges of semantic relations in the {ICNP}.},

The Comprehensive International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health ({ICF}) Core Set for Osteoarthritis is an application of the {ICF} and represents the typical spectrum of problems in functioning of patients with osteoarthritis. {OBJECTIVE} To validate the Comprehensive {ICF} Core Set for Osteoarthritis from the perspective of physical therapists. {METHODS} Physical therapists experienced in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis were asked about patients' problems, resources and aspects of the environmental factors treated by physical therapists in patients with osteoarthritis in a three-round, electronic-mail survey using the Delphi technique. Responses were linked to the {ICF}. {RESULTS} Seventy-two experts from 22 countries named 744 meaningful concepts that covered all {ICF} components. One hundred and fifty-two {ICF} categories were linked to these answers, 32 concepts were linked to the not-yet-developed personal factors component, and 14 issues were not covered by a single {ICF} category. Twelve {ICF} categories were not represented in the Comprehensive {ICF} Core Set for Osteoarthritis, although at least 75\% of the participants rated them as important. {DISCUSSION} {AND} {CONCLUSION} The content validity of the {ICF} was widely supported by the physical therapists. However, several issues were raised that were not covered and need to be investigated further.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine scale dimensionality,
reliability, invariance, targeting, continuity, cutoff scores, and
diagnostic use of the Geriatric Depression Scale--Short Form ({GDS}-{SF})
over time with a sample of 177 English-speaking U.S. elders. Design
and Methods: An item response theory, Rasch analysis, was conducted
with data from a larger study that implemented 3 interventions and
collected data at 3 time points (prior to intervention, after intervention,
and a year following the end of intervention). Results: A unidimensional
structure was found in this study to adequately fit the data. There
appears to be significant differential item functioning, with up
to one third of the items indicating that the items have different
meanings for different groups of participants. As a screening tool,
the {GDS}-{SF} is more likely to discriminate between older adults who
have a ``moderate��? level of depression than between those with
mild depression and no diagnosed depression. Implications: We would
recommend that the {GDS}-{SF} not be used as the sole method of screening

to the geriatric patient in question, given that not all items are
equally functional. The {GDS}-{SF} may be less effective as a screening
tool but could be better used to detect a change in moderate levels
of depression. Clinicians may also benefit by identifying person
responses that misfit. If an individual provides responses that are
atypical, the person might be referred to provide a more in-depth
assessment of mental health status.},

	abstract = {Background: There are well-defined and characteristic age-related
deficits in motor abilities that may reflect structural and chemical
changes in the aging brain.Objective: To delineate age-related changes
in the physiology of brain systems subserving simple motor behavior.Methods:
Ten strongly right-handed young ({\textless}35 years of age) and 12 strongly
right-handed elderly ({\textgreater}50 years of age) subjects with no evidence
of cognitive or motor deficits participated in the study. Whole-brain
functional imaging was performed on a 1.5-T {MRI} scanner using a spiral
pulse sequence while the subjects performed a visually paced ``button-press��?
motor task with their dominant right hand alternating with a rest
state.Results: Although the groups did not differ in accuracy, there
was an increase in reaction time in the elderly subjects (mean score
\$±\$ {SD}, young subjects = 547 \$±\$ 97 ms, elderly subjects = 794 \$±\$ 280
ms, p {\textless} 0.03). There was a greater extent of activation in the contralateral
sensorimotor cortex, lateral premotor area, supplementary motor area,
and ipsilateral cerebellum in the elderly subjects relative to the
young subjects (p {\textless} 0.001). Additional areas of activation, absent
in the young subjects, were seen in the ipsilateral sensorimotor
cortex, putamen (left {\textgreater} right), and contralateral cerebellum of the
elderly subjects.Conclusions: The results of this study show that
elderly subjects recruit additional cortical and subcortical areas
even for the performance of a simple motor task. These changes may
represent compensatory mechanisms invoked by the aging brain, such
as reorganization and redistribution of functional networks to compensate
for age-related structural and neurochemical changes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The present study was designed to identify prospectively the individual chronic characteristics associated with falling among elderly persons and to test the hypothesis that risk of falling increases as the number of chronic disabilities increases. Seventy-nine consecutive admissions to three intermediate care facilities were evaluated. Twenty-five of the subjects became recurrent fallers. The nine risk factors included in the fall risk index were mobility score, morale score, mental status score, distant vision, hearing, postural blood pressure, results of back examination, postadmission medications, and admission activities of daily living score. A subject's fall risk score was the number of index factors present. The proportions of recurrent falters increased from 0 percent (0 of 30) in those with 0 to three risk factors, to 31 percent (11 of 35) in those with four to six factors, to 100 percent (14 of 14) in those with seven or more factors. Falling, at least among some elderly persons, appears to result from the accumulated effect of multiple specific disabilities. Some of these disabilities may be remediable. The mobility test, the best single predictor of recurrent falling, may be useful clinically because it is simple, recreates fall situations, and provides a dynamic, integrated assessment of mobility.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The visibility of nursing care can be measured not only through patient outcomes but also by studying the existing data of patient care documentation. To have a common language and terminology in nursing is important for a universal understanding. {RESULTS} Some philosophical reasoning on the genesis and development of {ICNP} is discussed along with arguments for and against nursing classification systems. Some findings on Italian experimentation for nursing documentation as well as economical analysis are reported along with a vision for future development and utilization.},

Questionnaires were completed by 428 respondents, comprising a sample accessed via the Internet (n = 319) and a sample who completed a paper and pencil version of the measures (n = 109). Using confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) the two-factor structure of the {CPAQ} in the Internet sample was supported, though a good model fit was only achieved following the removal of one item. The resultant 19 item {CPAQ} demonstrated good reliability and evidence of validity was obtained for this sample. Data from the Internet sample were used to derive an eight-item short form. The two four-item factors (activity engagement [{AE}] and pain willingness [{PW}]) were confirmed using {CFA} and found to be invariant across both samples with good scale reliability. Higher {CPAQ}-8 and subscale scores were correlated with less depression and anxiety, pain severity and pain interference, and fewer medical visits for pain. Using structural equation modelling both subscales were found to partially mediate the impact of pain severity on pain interference and emotional distress. In this model {AE} had stronger associations with outcomes while {PW} accounted for a small portion of the variance in pain interference and anxiety, but not depression. This study confirmed the two-factor structure of the {CPAQ} in a mixed chronic pain Internet sample and provides preliminary evidence for the psychometric soundness of the {CPAQ}-8.},

A high level of confusion about these methods can be observed among students, researchers and even professional statisticians. How can a constructivist view of mathematical models and reality help to resolve the confusion? Method: Considerations about the foundations of statistics and probability are revisited with a constructivist attitude that explores which ways of thinking about the modelled phenomena are implied by different approaches to probability modelling. Results: The understanding of the implications of probability modelling for the quantification of evidence can be strongly improved by accepting that whether models are “true” or not cannot be checked from the data, and the use of the models should rather be justified and critically discussed in terms of their implications for the thinking and communication of researchers. Implications: Some useful questions that researchers can use as guidelines when deciding which approach and which model to choose are listed in the paper, along with some implications of using frequentist p-values or Bayesian posterior probability, which can help to address the questions. It is the -- far too often ignored -- responsibility of the researchers to decide which model is chosen and what the evidence suggests rather than letting the results decide themselves in an “objective way.”},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Indexes developed to measure physical functioning as an essential component of general health status are often based on sets of hierarchically-structured items intended to represent a broad underlying concept. Rasch Item Response Theory ({IRT}) provides a methodology to examine the hierarchical structure, unidimensionality, and reproducibility of item positions (calibrations) along a scale. Data gathered on the 10-item Physical Functioning Scale ({PF}-10) from a large sample of Medical Outcomes Study patients (N = 3445) were used to examine the hierarchical order, unidimensionality, and reproducibility of item calibrations. Rasch-{IRT} analyses generated an empirical item hierarchy, confirmed the unidimensionality of the {PF}-10 for most patients, and established the reproducibility of item calibrations across patient populations and repeated tests. These findings support the content validity of the {PF}-10 as a measure of physical functioning and suggest that valid Rasch-{IRT} summary scores could be generated as an alternative to the current Likert summative scores. Unidimensionality and reproducibility of the item scale are essential prerequisites for the development of Rasch-based person measures of physical functioning that can be used across populations and over repeated tests.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods: First, we dissected nursing diagnosis term phrases from two source terminologies (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association Taxonomy 1 ({NANDA}) and Omaha System) into the semantic categories of the European Committee for Standardization ({CEN}) categorical structure and {ISO} reference terminology model ({RTM}). Second, we critically analyzed the similarities between the semantic links in the {CEN} and {ISO} models and the semantic links used to formally define diagnostic concepts in {SNOMED} {CT}. Results: Our findings demonstrated that focus, bearer/subject of information, and judgment were present in 100\% of the {NANDA} and Omaha term phrases. The Omaha term phrases contained no additional descriptors beyond those considered mandatory in the {CEN} and {ISO} models. The comparison among the semantic links showed that {SNOMED} {CT} currently contains all but one of the semantic links needed to model the two source terminologies for integration. In conclusion, our findings support the potential utility of the {CEN} and {ISO} models for integrating nursing diagnostic concepts into {SNOMED} {CT}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Responses were linked to the {ICF}. {RESULTS} Seventy-nine physicians in 41 countries named 512 patients' problems. Two hundred and 27 {ICF} categories were linked to these answers. Twenty-six {ICF} categories were not represented in the Comprehensive {ICF} Core Set for rheumatoid arthritis and 19 aspects were not covered by the {ICF}. {CONCLUSION} The content validity of 3 {ICF} components was well supported.

	abstract = {Recent revisions of Gray's reinforcement sensitivity theory ({RST}) have important implications for self-report measures of approach and avoidance behaviours and how Gray's model relates to other personality models. In this paper, we examine the revised {RST} by comparing Carver and White's (1994) original one-factor solution of the {BIS} scale with two alternative two-factor solutions separating {BIS}-Anxiety and {FFFS}-Fear. We also examine the relationships between Eysenck's {PEN} and revised {RST} factors. Two hundred and twelve participants completed Carver and White's {BIS}/{BAS} scales and Eysenck's Personality Questionnaire-Revised. Confirmatory factor analyses of the original {BIS} scale showed that the hypothesized two-factor model of {BIS}-Anxiety and {FFFS}-Fear was the best fit to these data. Associations between the revised {RST} and Eysenck's {PEN} were examined using path analysis. In line with theoretical predictions, Psychoticism was related to revised {BIS}-Anxiety and {BAS}, Neuroticism to revised {BIS}-Anxiety and {FFFS}-Fear, and extraversion to {BAS} and {FFFS}-Fear. Distinctions between {BAS} subscales and their associations to {BIS}, N and P were made in terms of past, present and future focus.

	abstract = {The paper aims at answering the question: Has the measurement of patient satisfaction improved the quality of care? After concluding that there is no evidence in the literature, the paper proceeds to look at why the evidence is lacking. Four factors seem to explain it: the objectives, the focus and the originator of the patients satisfaction studies and measurements and difficulties related to the interpretation of the findings. The last part of the paper analyses why patient satisfaction should be taken seriously although we do not know whether its measurement improves the quality of care. They include the fact that the patients are partners in health care; they literally feel in their skin whether care is good or bad. They are also the best judges of certain aspects of care, such as amenities and interpersonal relations. The second reason is the transformation of health care from a sellers market to a consumers' market where the satisfaction of the patients needs is part of the definition of quality. Finally, there is the ideological reason that, in a democratic society, the patients should have the right to influence decisions and activities influencing them. Measurement of patient satisfaction realizes the principle of community participation in health care.},

	abstract = {Despite the long history of therapeutic experience with different types and amounts of passive joint motion, its effects and the principles of its use remain controversial. Through empiric success, a spectrum of passive motion has evolved for various clinical purposes, including joint diagnosis; correction of joint deformities; mobilization of stiff joints; stimulation of joint healing; neuromuscular re-education; and prevention of immobilization complications (e.g., contracture formation, connective tissue atrophy, relative healing inhibition, and associated stasis abnormalities). However, the potential abuses of passive motion (e.g., causing additional tissue trauma, mobilizing unprotected joints, and stretching the wrong joints or tissues) have created serious doubts as to the value of this therapy and raised important questions concerning the lack of proper definition (e.g., force, direction, speed, and duration) and the unknown margins of safety. Clinical and experimental evidence supports the probable effectiveness of passive joint motion on joint and tissue levels, but without a better quantitative understanding of the mechanisms of action, dose-responsiveness, specific tissue effects, and, most important, their controls. Thus, passive motion will continue to be used suboptimally with inconsistent results. When these clinical and research deficiencies are corrected, passive motion will attain its proper place as a powerful and reliable orthopedic tool.},

	title = {Introduction and development of {NCP} using {ICNP} in Pakistan},
	volume = {52},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Traditionally, nursing care has been described as performing nursing tasks and often focused on nurses carrying out doctors' orders. In many countries of the world, including Pakistan, nurses do not document care in a standardized manner. Because of this limitation many health administrators, policy makers, and consumers make inadequate assumptions about nursing work, often regarding nurses as any other 'health care technician' who can be easily replaced by more economical health care workers. {PURPOSE} To overcome this problem, standardized documentation is being introduced into the Aga Khan University School of Nursing and hospital, Aga Khan Health Services, Public Health School in Karachi, and government colleges of nursing, using the International Classification for Nursing Practice ({ICNP}). The purpose of this paper is to highlight the process of introducing and developing standardized nursing care plans ({NCP}) using {ICNP} in Pakistan. {PROCESS} The process for introducing {ICNP} consists of four components, including administrative planning, development, teaching and training, and testing. Subsets of the {ICNP} for (i) maternity: antenatal, postnatal and natal care; and (ii) cardiology were developed using standardized {NCPs}. The subsets were developed by nurse experts and introduced at the testing sites. The testing will be conducted as a pilot project. Findings from the pilot will be used to continue and expand standardized nursing documentation using the {ICNP} across Pakistan. {CONCLUSION} Through this project, nurses, midwives and lady health visitors (midwives, vaccinator and health educators) will test standardization of documentation and begin to evaluate efficiency and effectiveness of clinical practice.},

Responses were linked to the {ICF}. {RESULTS} 57 nurses in 15 countries named 1170 concepts that covered all {ICF} components. 20 concepts were linked to the as yet undeveloped {ICF} component Personal Factors. 19 {ICF} categories are not represented in the Comprehensive {ICF} Core Set for {RA}. {CONCLUSION} The validity of the Comprehensive {ICF} Core Set for {RA} was largely supported by the nurses.

A consensus is emerging that there is a need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding a range of selected topics in nursing education. The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the available literature in order to synthesize the effects of {PBL} in nursing education. Using a number of databases, we identified studies related to the effectiveness of {PBL} in nursing. An analysis was conducted on a range of outcome variables, including overall effect sizes and effects of evidence and evaluation levels, learning environment, and study characteristics. We found that the effect of {PBL} in nursing education is 0.70 standard deviations (medium-to-large effect size). We also found that {PBL} has positive effects on the outcome domains of satisfaction with training, clinical education, and skill course. These results may act as a guide for nurse educators with regard to the conditions under which {PBL} is more effective than traditional learning strategies.},

Data from 2,262 inpatients obtained over a period of 9 weeks (May to July 2003) were extracted from the {EMR} system for analysis. Among the 530,218 data-input events, 401,190 (75.7\%) were entered from the {NDD}, 20,550 (3.9\%) used only free text, and 108,478 (20.4\%) used a combination of coded data and free text. A content analysis of the free-text events showed that 80.3\% of the expressions could be found in the {NDD}, whereas 10.9\% were context-specific expressions such as direct quotations of patient complaints and responses, and references to the care plan or orders of physicians. A total of 7.8\% of the expressions was used for a supplementary purpose such as adding a conjunction or end verb to make an expression appear as natural language. Only 1.0\% of the expressions were identified as not being covered by the {NDD}. This evaluation study demonstrates that the {ICNP}-based {NDD} has sufficient power to cover most of the expressions used in a clinical nursing setting.},

	volume = {36},
	abstract = {The use of mindfulness training for increasing psychological well-being in a variety of clinical and nonclinical populations has exploded over the last decade. In the area of stuttering, it has been widely recognized that effective long-term management often necessitates treatment of cognitive and affective dimensions of the disorder in addition to behavioral components. Yet, mindfulness based strategies and their possible usefulness in stuttering management have not been described in detail in the literature. This article seeks to engage professionals who treat stuttering in a conversation about the possible usefulness of incorporating mindfulness training into stuttering management. A review of the literature reveals that there is a substantial overlap between what is required for effective stuttering management and the benefits provided by mindfulness practices. Mindfulness practice results in decreased avoidance, increased emotional regulation, and acceptance in addition to improved sensory-perceptual processing and attentional regulation skills. These skills are important for successful long-term stuttering management on both psychosocial and sensory-motor levels. It is concluded that the integration of mindfulness training and stuttering treatment appears practical and worthy of exploration. Mindfulness strategies adapted for people who stutter may help in the management of cognitive, affective, and behavioral challenges associated with stuttering. Educational objectives: Readers should be able to: (1) describe what mindfulness is and how it is cultivated; (2) identify the benefits that can be produced from mindfulness practice; (3) summarize how the benefits of mindfulness practice parallel what is often required for effective long-term stuttering management; and (4) identify specific mindfulness techniques that can be taught in stuttering therapy and explain their rationale.},

The responses were linked to the {ICF} by two persons. The degree of agreement was calculated using Kappa statistic. {RESULTS} Eighty-eight physicians in 30 countries named 2142 patients' problems that covered all {ICF} components. Two hundred seventy-seven {ICF} categories were linked to these. Kappa statistic for agreement reached 0.68 with a 95\% confidence interval of 0.66-0.69. Although 28 {ICF} categories were not represented in the {ICF} Core Set for stroke, only four of them were considered as important by at least 75\% of the participants. Those categories addressed sensations associated with cardiovascular and respiratory functions, urinary excretory functions, involuntary movement functions and sensations related to muscle and movement functions. {CONCLUSION} The validity of the {ICF} components Body structures, Activities and Participation, and Environ-mental Factors was fully supported. Only some body functions were identified that were not covered and need to be investigated further.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the representation of health asset concepts in the International Classification of Nursing Practice ({ICNP}). In a previous study we conducted a concept analysis of health assets, building a conceptual model. The terms included in our conceptual model were cross-mapped to the {ICNP} terminology system, Version 1.0/1.1. Most of the health asset terms in the conceptual model were represented in {ICNP}. However, for maximum support of both clinical nursing care and patient self-care, a complete set of health asset terms is needed in the {ICNP}. We advocate for more research to uncover patients' and clinicians' detailed use of health asset terms. This should result in a richer and more specific health assets vocabulary that could be integrated into {ICNP} or other nursing terminologies as a means to improve nursing care and to strengthen patients' self-management of their illnesses. However, the findings from this first evaluation of health asset terms in the {ICNP} are promising, at least on a global level.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE} Development of an adaptive, International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health ({ICF})-oriented patient questionnaire on mobility and self-care based on an item response theory model ({MOSES} questionnaire). {METHODS} Using item reconstruction rules, items were developed for the {ICF} chapters "mobility", "self-care" and "domestic life". The resulting instrument, together with other instruments ({SF}-36, Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment Questionnaire ({SMFA}), {MacNew}, Functional Independence Measure ({FIM}), Barthel) was presented to 549 patients with musculoskeletal disease, 212 patients with cardiac disease and 258 neurological rehabilitation patients in rehabilitation clinics in Germany. {RESULTS} The {MOSES} questionnaire includes 58 items on 12 scales and fulfills the requirements of the 1-parameter item response theory model (Rasch model). The results indicate good reliability and high construct validity and sensitivity to change of the instrument. In the construction and selection of items, {ICF} contents that include complex processes of evaluation, and which presuppose skills that are not acquired prior to the individual learning process, were omitted due to a lack of unidimensionality. {CONCLUSION} The successful implementation of the concept of applying rules to {ICF} categories in formulating the items of a patient questionnaire showed that the goal of a theory-driven measurement of activities using the {ICF} is feasible. The results of the project also raise questions as to the homogeneity of the contents of some {ICF} categories.},

	abstract = {Rasch item response theory analysis is essential in evaluating measurement tools in specific disease cohorts. We compared the performance of 4 functional indexes in patients with psoriatic arthritis ({PsA}) in axial or peripheral disease subgroups.A cross-sectional study was performed in a single center. Functional outcomes assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire ({HAQ}), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index ({BASFI}), Dougados Functional Index ({FI}), and the physical functioning scale of the Medical Outcome Study Short-form 36 ({SF}-36-{PF}) were analyzed by the Rasch model for item fit, item separation, measurement span, and distribution properties. Patient subgroups with axial or peripheral disease were analyzed for differential item functioning ({DIF}).One hundred eight patients with {PsA} were assessed. The 4 functional indexes were highly correlated with each other and moderately correlated with patients' perception of health and pain scores. Floor effects were less marked in {SF}-36-{PF}. The 4 indexes satisfied the unidimensionality assumption of the Rasch model. {HAQ} and {SF}-36-{PF} had better information-weighted fit statistics ({INFIT}) and outlier-sensitive ({OUTFIT}) statistics. {HAQ} had the poorest item separation. {SF}-36-{PF} had the highest item separation (6.99), reliability (0.85), and the longest span of item threshold (9.03 logits). Only 1 and 2 items in {BASFI} and Dougados-{FI} had {DIF} in patients with sacroiliitis.{HAQ}, {BASFI}, Dougados-{FI}, and {SF}-36-{PF} provide unidimensional measures of functional disability in {PsA}. {SF}-36-{PF} was the best in terms of less floor effect, highest item separation, longest span of item threshold, and better distributional properties. {BASFI} and Dougados-{FI} behaved similarly in patients with and without sacroiliitis and conferred no superiority in patients with axial disease.},

This structure was validated for a sample of undergraduate students using confirmatory factor analysis. Additional validity evidence was obtained through the correlation of the {SATS} with Wise's Attitudes Toward Statistics scale, which showed significant, positive relationships between the two instruments.},

This conception is shown to diverge from current validity theory in several respects. In particular, the emphasis in the proposed conception is on ontology, reference, and causality, whereas current validity theory focuses on epistemology, meaning, and correlation. It is argued that the proposed conception is not only simpler but also theoretically superior to the position taken in the existing literature. Further, it has clear theoretical and practical implications for validation research. Most important, validation research must not be directed at the relation between the measured attribute and other attributes but at the processes that convey the effect of the measured attribute on the test scores.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: There are no nursing centric data in the hospital discharge abstract. This study investigates whether adding nursing data in the form of nursing diagnoses to medical diagnostic data in the discharge abstract can improve overall explanation of variance in commonly studied hospital outcomes. Method: A retrospective analyses of 123,241 sequential patient admissions to a university hospital in a Midwestern city was performed. Two data sets were combined: (1) a daily collection of patient assessments by nurses using nursing diagnosis terminology ({NDX}); and (2) the summary discharge information from the hospital discharge abstract including diagnosis-related group ({DRG}) and all payer refined {DRG} ({APR}-{DRG}). Each of 61 daily {NDX} observations were collapsed as frequency of occurrence for the hospital stay and inserted into the discharge abstract. {NDX} was then compared to both {DRG} and {APR}-{DRG} across 5 hospital outcome variables using multivariate regression or logistic regression. Results and conclusions: In all statistical models, {DRG}, {APR}-{DRG}, and {NDX} were significantly associated with the 5 hospital outcome variables (P {\textless}.0001). When {NDX} was added to models containing either the {DRG} or the {APR}-{DRG}, explanatory power (R2) and model discrimination (c statistic) improved by 30\% to 146\% across the outcome variables of hospital length of stay, {ICU} length of stay, total charges, probably of death, and discharge to a nursing home (P {\textless}.0001). The findings support the contention that nursing care is an independent predictor of patient hospital outcomes. These nursing data are not redundant with the medical diagnosis, in particular, the {DRG}. The findings support the argument for including nursing care data in the hospital discharge abstract. Further study is needed to clarify which nursing data are the best fit for the current hospital discharge abstract data collection scheme. (C) 2005 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

South Africa had 2 research groups. One of the research groups identified the term cultural diversity to define. {METHOD} This was a qualitative study where a philosophical perspective was used to explore, explain and describe nursing practice. The combined method proposed by the International Council of Nurses ({ICN}) was utilised to define and validate the term cultural diversity. {FINDINGS} Validation and literature review provided sufficient support for the defined characteristics and the term was finally defined and submitted to {ICN} in November 2002 as: {CULTURAL} {DIVERSITY} is a type of {CULTURE} with the specific characteristics: co-existence of different groups, e.g. ethnic, religious, linguistic and other groups each with their own values and belief systems, traditions and different lifestyles. {CONCLUSION} The research group was informed in December 2003 of the {ICNP} Evaluation Committee recommendation that the term cultural diversity will be included in the {ICNP}.},

	volume = {32},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: recent studies have found that moderate intensity exercise is an effective intervention strategy for preventing falls in older people. However, research is required to determine whether supervised group exercise programmes, conducted in community settings with at-risk older people referred by their health care practitioner are also effective in improving physical functioning and preventing falls in this group. {OBJECTIVES}: to determine whether participation in a weekly group exercise programme with ancillary home exercises over one year improves balance, muscle strength, reaction time, physical functioning, health status and prevents falls in at-risk community-dwelling older people. {METHODS}: the sample comprised 163 people aged over 65 years identified as at risk of falling using a standardised assessment screen by their general practitioner or hospital-based physiotherapist, residing in South Western Sydney, Australia. Subjects were randomised into either an exercise intervention group or a control group. Physical performance and general health measures were assessed at baseline and repeated 6-months into the trial. Falls were measured over a 12-month follow-up period using monthly postal surveys. {RESULTS}: at baseline both groups were well matched in their physical performance, health and activity levels. The intervention subjects attended a median of 23 exercise classes over the year, and most undertook the home exercise sessions at least weekly. At retest, the exercise group performed significantly better than the controls in three of six balance measures; postural sway on the floor with eyes open and eyes closed and coordinated stability. The groups did not differ at retest in measures of strength, reaction time and walking speed or on Short-Form 36, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly or fear of falling scales. Within the 12-month trial period, the rate of falls in the intervention group was 40\% lower than that of the control group ({IRR}=0.60, 95\% {CI} 0.36-0.99). {CONCLUSIONS}: these findings indicate that participation in a weekly group exercise programme with ancillary home exercises can improve balance and reduce the rate of falling in at-risk community dwelling older people.},

	abstract = {Stress has been defined in different ways over the years. Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person. The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual. It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation. Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others. Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).View this table:In this {windowIn} a new window Box 1: The problem of stress Signs of stress can be seen in people\&\#039;s behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches). If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1).1View this table:In this {windowIn} a new window Box 2 : Signs of stress Figure 1 A model of stress at work.1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations. Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.

	title = {An ontological approach to support the description of nursing practice in Japan with the {ICNP}},
	volume = {76},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} With increasing computerization of nursing records in Japan, standardization of nursing terminology is becoming imperative. Although some efforts have been made to formalize description of nursing practice in Japan with the International Classification of Nursing Practice ({ICNP}), lack of effective description tools has impacted negatively on the initiatives. {PURPOSE} To develop and evaluate an ontological approach that could be used to facilitate the description of nursing practice in Japan with the {ICNP}. {METHODOLOGY} An ontology-based support system was developed using Protégé-2000, mainly by the following three steps: (1) representing a standard classification of nursing practice (the Nursing Master) in Japan; (2) representing a Japanese version of the {ICNP}; (3) designing an ontology-based framework. A heuristic matching algorithm was developed to automatically match the action labels in the Nursing Master with the terms of the eight axes of the {ICNP} Nursing Actions Classification. A preliminary evaluation was performed to examine the usefulness of the system. {RESULTS} High hit rate was shown on the {ICNP} axes {ActionType}, Target, and Location. The evaluation indicated that 51.7+/-5.8\% (mean+/-S.D.) of the action labels with only one action type were properly matched, and that in 80+/-4\% (mean+/-S.D.) of action labels with more than one action type, at least one valid action type was matched correctly. {CONCLUSION} The ontology-based approach using a frame-based knowledge representation system (e.g., Protégé-2000) is useful for supporting the formal description of nursing practice in Japan with the {ICNP}.},

	volume = {9},
	abstract = {Local independence in the Rasch model can be violated in two generic ways that are generally not distinguished clearly in the literature. In this paper we distinguish between a violation of unidimensionality, which we call trait dependence, and a specific violation of statistical independence, which we call response dependence, both of which violate local independence. Distinct algebraic formulations for trait and response dependence are developed as violations of the dichotomous Rasch model, data are simulated with varying degrees of dependence according to these formulations, and then analysed according to the Rasch model assuming no violations. Relative to the case of no violation it is shown that trait and response dependence result in opposite effects on the unit of scale as manifested in the range and standard deviation of the scale and the standard deviation of person locations. In the case of trait dependence the scale is reduced; in the case of response dependence it is increased. Again, relative to the case of no violation, the two violations also have opposite effects on the person separation index (analogous to Cronbach's alpha reliability index of traditional test theory in value and construction): it decreases for data with trait dependence; it increases for data with response dependence. A standard way of accounting for dependence is to combine the dependent items into a higher-order polytomous item. This typically results in a decreased person separation index index and Cronbach's alpha, compared with analysing items as discrete, independent items. This occurs irrespective of the kind of dependence in the data, and so further contributes to the two violations not being distinguished clearly. In an attempt to begin to distinguish between them statistically this paper articulates the opposite effects of these two violations in the dichotomous Rasch model.},

	abstract = {Objective To describe the systematic language translation and cross-cultural evaluation process that assessed the relevance of the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey in five European countries prior to national data collection efforts.Design An approach involving a systematic translation process, expert review by experienced researchers and a review by `patient' experts involving the use of content validity indexing techniques with chance correction.Setting Five European countries where Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian and Polish are spoken.Participants `Patient' experts who had recently experienced a hospitalization in the participating country.Main {OutcomeMeasure}(s) Content validity indexing with chance correction adjustment providing a quantifiable measure that evaluates the conceptual, contextual, content, semantic and technical equivalence of the instrument in relationship to the patient care experience.Results All translations except two received `excellent' ratings and no significant differences existed between scores for languages spoken in more than one country. Patient raters across all countries expressed different concerns about some of the demographic questions and their relevance for evaluating patient satisfaction. Removing demographic questions from the evaluation produced a significant improvement in the scale-level scores (P= .018). The cross-cultural evaluation process suggested that translations and content of the patient satisfaction survey were relevant across countries and languages.Conclusions The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey is relevant to some European hospital systems and has the potential to produce internationally comparable patient satisfaction scores.},

	abstract = {Therapeutic interventions that incorporate training in mindfulness meditation have become increasingly popular, but to date little is known about neural mechanisms associated with these interventions. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ({MBSR}), one of the most widely used mindfulness training programs, has been reported to produce positive effects on psychological well-being and to ameliorate symptoms of a number of disorders. Here, we report a controlled longitudinal study to investigate pre-post changes in brain gray matter concentration attributable to participation in an {MBSR} program. Anatomical magnetic resonance ({MR}) images from 16 healthy, meditation-naïve participants were obtained before and after they underwent the 8-week program. Changes in gray matter concentration were investigated using voxel-based morphometry, and compared with a waiting list control group of 17 individuals. Analyses in a priori regions of interest confirmed increases in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus. Whole brain analyses identified increases in the posterior cingulate cortex, the temporo-parietal junction, and the cerebellum in the {MBSR} group compared with the controls. The results suggest that participation in {MBSR} is associated with changes in gray matter concentration in brain regions involved in learning and memory processes, emotion regulation, self-referential processing, and perspective taking.},

They were administered the Mindfulness/Mindlessness Scale [{MMS}; Bodner, T., \& Langer, E. (2001). Individual differences in mindfulness: The Langer Mindfulness Scale. Poster session presented at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Society, Toronto, Ont., Canada], Dispositional Flow Scale 2 [{DFS}-2; Jackson, S. A., \& Eklund, R. C. (2004).

Test of performance strategies: Development and preliminary validation of a comprehensive measure of athletes' psychological skills. Journal of Sports Sciences, 17, 697-711].Results Four distinctive mindfulness clusters were found based on their response on the {MMS} using cluster analysis. Marked differences in flow dispositions and mental skills adoption habits were observed between the high and the low mindfulness clusters. Those in the high mindfulness cluster scored significantly higher than the low mindfulness clusters in challenge-skill balance, merging of action and awareness, clear goals, concentration and loss of self-consciousness scores of the {DFS}-2 [Jackson, S.A., \& Eklund, R.C. (2004). The flow scale manual. Morgantown, {WV}: Fitness Information Technology]. The high mindfulness clusters also scored significantly higher compared to the low mindfulness cluster in terms of attentional control, emotional control, goal setting and self-talk sub-scales of the {TOPS}.Conclusions This study suggests that athletes' flow dispositions and mental skills adoption could be differentiated using mindfulness. The findings have implications towards the understanding of flow and mental skills adoption within sport psychology.},

	abstract = {Cross-mapping the terms of International Classification for Nursing Practice ({ICNP}) with the handwritten nursing records of gynecological patients at one district of private teaching hospital in the south of Taiwan was conducted in July and August, 2004. The purpose of this study was to validate the applicability of {ICNP} for electronic nursing records in a gynecological setting. A Chinese version of the {ICNP} beta 2 browser was used to code nursing record sentences. Medical charts were reviewed until data were saturated. A total of sixty-two patient records were analyzed, producing 6,327 sentences, this included 1,918 sentences on nursing phenomena (30.3\%) and 4,409 sentences on nursing action (69.7\%). The ratio between the two was about 1:2.3. Coded sentences were compared according to the four levels of applicability with the original records, each was identified as a "perfect fit", "conceptual fit", "partial fit", or "unable to fit". Of the 6,327 sentences, 2,041 (32.3\%) were designated as "perfect fit", 2,457 (38.8\%) as "conceptual fit", 1,663 (26.3\%) as "partial fit", and 166 (2.6\%) as "unable to fit". The top ten most described nursing phenomena included: acute pain, high temperature, conscious change, potential infection risk, state of mind change, potential risk patient's mobility change endurance level, gastrointestinal function obstacles, changes in urination, anxiety, and diarrhea. The top ten most described nursing actions included: observe surgical wounds, monitor vital signs, changes of mentality, instruction on medication, arranging clinical check ups, wound infection prevention, urinary drainage tube and urine nature observation, checking for vaginal drainage, pre/post-operative healthcare, and discharge planning. Study results indicated that 71.1\% of sentences could be cross-mapped. Further validation is suggested to validate {ICNP} in other gynecological hospitals.},

The intraclass correlation for a set of classes in which the order of the values is arbitrary (and independent from one class to the next) is a non-negative quantity. Negative estimates are possible and can be interpreted as indicating that the true intraclass correlation is low, that is, two members chosen randomly from any class vary almost as much as any two randomly chosen members of the whole population.},

Results from 29 empirical studies examining emotional Stroop or dot probe results in depressed participants (clinical depression, nonclinical dysphoria, and subjects undergoing depressive mood induction) were examined. Studies using the emotional Stroop task yielded marginally significant evidence of a difference between depressed and nondepressed samples, whereas those using the dot probe task showed significant differences between groups (d = 0.52). We found no evidence for significant moderation of these effects by age, sex, type of depressed sample, year of publication, stimulus presentation duration, or type of stimuli (verbal or nonverbal), although statistical power for these tests was limited. These results support the existence of biased attention to negative information in depression. Depression and Anxiety, 2010.© 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The present study tested the efficacy of an 8-week Mindfulness-based stress reduction ({MBSR}) meditation program compared to a 1-day control seminar on {CD}4+ T lymphocyte counts in stressed {HIV} infected adults. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with enrollment and follow-up occurring between November 2005 and December 2007. A diverse community sample of 48 {HIV}-1 infected adults was randomized and entered treatment in either an 8-week {MBSR} or a 1-day control stress reduction education seminar. The primary outcome was circulating counts of {CD}4+ T lymphocytes. Participants in the 1-day control seminar showed declines in {CD}4+ T lymphocyte counts whereas counts among participants in the 8-week {MBSR} program were unchanged from baseline to post-intervention (time × treatment condition interaction, p = .02). This effect was independent of antiretroviral ({ARV}) medication use. Additional analyses indicated that treatment adherence to the mindfulness meditation program, as measured by class attendance, mediated the effects of mindfulness meditation training on buffering {CD}4+ T lymphocyte declines. These findings provide an initial indication that mindfulness meditation training can buffer {CD}4+ T lymphocyte declines in {HIV}-1 infected adults.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Ageing is characterized by a number of physical changes that contribute to a decline in the ability to perform daily tasks. Stretching has been proposed to reduce hip flexion contracture and increase hip and pelvis range of motion, thus improving gait performance. {OBJECTIVE}: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a supervised stretching program designed to improve the range of motion of the lower limbs alters gait kinematics in older adults. {METHODS}: Twenty healthy older adult women (65.9 +/- 4.2 years old and {BMI} 24.9 +/- 3.5) were divided into 2 groups. The experimental group undertook 12 sessions of stretching exercises, whereas the control group did not engage in any physical activity. Gait performance was assessed at the beginning of the experiment and after the 4-week intervention period. {RESULTS}: Those in the experimental group showed increased step length, higher velocity and reduced double support time after training. In addition, participants involved in the stretching program showed greater anterior and lateral pelvis tilt and also greater rotation (p {\textless} 0.05). {CONCLUSIONS}: Based on our results, we can suggest that a supervised stretching program is effective to alter a number of gait variables. Moreover, after the stretching protocol, aged participants displayed gait parameters which were similar to those reported in young healthy adults. Therefore, stretching can be used as an effective means to improve range of motion and reverse some age-related changes that influence gait performance.},

A quantitative relation between the involved time scales is theoretically derived. This relation is found to be satisfied by empirically obtained cognitive time scales relevant for bistable perception.},

	abstract = {This study evaluated the effectiveness of an 8-week mindfulness training for children aged 8--12 with {ADHD} and parallel mindful parenting training for their parents. Parents (N = 22) completed questionnaires on their child's {ADHD} and {ODD} symptoms, their own {ADHD} symptoms, parenting stress, parental overreactivity, permissiveness and mindful awareness before, immediately after the 8-week training and at 8-week follow-up. Teachers reported on {ADHD} and {ODD} behavior of the child. A within-group waitlist was used to control for the effects of time and repeated measurement. Training was delivered in group format. There were no significant changes between wait-list and pre-test, except on the increase of teacher-rated {ODD} behavior. There was a significant reduction of parent-rated {ADHD} behavior of themselves and their child from pre-to posttest and from pre- to follow-up test. Further, there was a significant increase of mindful awareness from pre-to posttest and a significant reduction of parental stress and overreactivity from pre-to follow-up test. Teacher-ratings showed non-significant effects. Our study shows preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness for children with {ADHD} and their parents, as rated by parents. However, in the absence of substantial effects on teacher-ratings, we cannot ascertain effects are due to specific treatment procedures.},

Immediately, the tick will pause momentarily and appear to be longer than the subsequent ticks. Yet, they all last exactly one second. By and large, a deviant or an unexpected stimulus in a series of similar events (same duration, same features) can elicit a relative overestimation of subjective time (or "time dilation") but, as is shown here, this is not always the case. We conducted an event-related functional magnetic neuroimaging ({fMRI}) study on the time dilation effect. Participants were presented with a series of five visual discs, all static and of equal duration (standards) except for the fourth one, a looming or a receding target. The duration of the target was systematically varied and participants judged whether it was shorter or longer than all other standards in the sequence. Subjective time dilation was observed for the looming stimulus but not for the receding one, which was estimated to be of equal duration to the standards. The neural activation for targets (looming and receding) contrasted with the standards revealed an increased activation of the anterior insula and of the anterior cingulate cortex. Contrasting the looming with the receding targets (i.e. capturing the time dilation effect proper) revealed a specific activation of cortical midline structures. The implication of midline structures in the time dilation illusion is here interpreted in the context of self-referential processes.},

	volume = {1},
	abstract = {The Sexual Experiences Survey (Koss, Gidycz, \& Wisniewski, 1987) is a commonly used instrument for assessing various degrees of sexual aggression and victimization among male offenders and female victims. Rasch analysis was used to transform qualitative raw score observations into objective linear measures using the responses of a national sample of 6,159 higher education men and women across the United States, aged 18-24. This paper supports the construct validity of the survey through evaluation of the item hierarchy, fit statistics, and separation indices. Findings confirm a "dimensional" perspective on rape, suggesting that sexually aggressive behaviors can be scaled along a single continuum from normal to extreme sexual behavior. The item hierarchy reveals an arrangement of sexually aggressive acts in an order of mild to severe, which compares with the one theorized by the authors of the {SES}. Identity plots demonstrate the validity of using a common set of {SES} item calibrations to measure both male and female respondents. For interpretation of person responses to the {SES}, three conclusions are suggested. First, Rasch analysis must be employed to examine item responses effectively. Second, when the survey is administered to a college sample aged 18-24, the item calibrations obtained in this paper can be used to measure offenders and victims. Third, a total raw score-to-measure conversion is not always sufficient to interpret person measures. Instead, a scalogram method needs be added to the Rasch analysis to separate the measures of offenders and victims who complete the survey. Implications for future research are discussed.},

	title = {Development of a Provisional Domain Model for the Nursing Process for Use within the Health Level 7 Reference Information Model},
	volume = {11},
	abstract = {Objective Since 1999, the Nursing Terminology Summits have promoted
the development, evaluation, and use of reference terminology for
nursing and its integration into comprehensive health care data standards.
The use of such standards to represent nursing knowledge, terminology,
processes, and information in electronic health records will enhance
continuity of care, decision support, and the exchange of comparable
patient information. As part of this activity, working groups at
the 2001, 2002, and 2003 Summit Conferences examined how to represent
nursing information in the Health Level 7 ({HL}7) Reference Information
Model ({RIM}).Design The working groups represented the nursing process
as a dynamic sequence of phases, each containing information specific
to the activities of the phase. They used Universal Modeling Language
({UML}) to represent this domain knowledge in models. An Activity Diagram
was used to create a dynamic model of the nursing process. After
creating a structural model of the information used at each stage
of the nursing process, the working groups mapped that information
to the {HL}7 {RIM}. They used a hierarchical structure for the organization
of nursing knowledge as the basis for a hierarchical model for ``Findings
about the patient.��? The modeling and mapping reported here were
exploratory and preliminary, not exhaustive or definitive. The intent
was to evaluate the feasibility of representing some types of nursing
information consistently with {HL}7 standards.Measurements The working
groups conducted a small-scale validation by testing examples of
nursing terminology against the {HL}7 {RIM} class ``Observation.��?Results
It was feasible to map patient information from the proposed models
to the {RIM} class ``Observation.��? Examples illustrate the models
and the mapping of nursing terminology to the {HL}7 {RIM}.Conclusion
It is possible to model and map nursing information into the comprehensive
health care information model, the {HL}7 {RIM}. These models must evolve
and undergo further validation by clinicians. The integration of
nursing information, terminology, and processes in information models
is a first step toward rendering nursing information machine-readable
in electronic patient records and messages. An eventual practical
result, after much more development, would be to create computable,
structured information for nursing documentation.},

Two health professionals linked responses to the {ICF}. {FINDINGS} Sixty-nine occupational therapists in 21 countries named 1,747 concepts that occupational therapists treat in patients with stroke. These concepts were linked to 347 different {ICF} categories. Twenty-three concepts were linked to the {ICF} component Personal Factors. {CONCLUSION} The content validity of the "{ICF} Core Set for stroke" was largely supported by occupational therapists.},

	abstract = {Mindfulness has been proposed as a useful adjunct to alcohol abuse treatment. However, very little research has examined the basic relationship between alcohol use and mindfulness. Inconsistency in definition and measurement of mindfulness across studies makes such research difficult to interpret and conduct. Therefore, the current research sought to validate an emerging mindfulness measure, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire ({FFMQ}), and examine its relationship with alcohol use and alcohol-related negative consequences among a sample of 316 college-aged adults. The purported factor structure of the {FFMQ} was examined using confirmatory factor analysis. Structural equation modeling was used to examine relations among mindfulness, alcohol use, and alcohol-related negative consequences. Consistent with past research, results supported the five-factor structure of the {FFMQ}. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that two awareness-based factors of mindfulness were negatively related to alcohol use. After controlling for alcohol use, one acceptance-based factor (nonjudging of thoughts and feelings) was negatively related to alcohol-related consequences, and one awareness-based factor was positively related to consequences (all ps {\textless} .05). Effect sizes were small-medium. The results reported here inform the burgeoning development of mindfulness-based addiction treatment and provide additional psychometric validation of the {FFMQ}.},

	title = {Neurobiology of the structure of personality: dopamine, facilitation of incentive motivation, and extraversion},
	volume = {22},
	abstract = {Extraversion has two central characteristics: (1) interpersonal engagement, which consists of affiliation (enjoying and valuing close interpersonal bonds, being warm and affectionate) and agency (being socially dominant, enjoying leadership roles, being assertive, being exhibitionistic, and having a sense of potency in accomplishing goals) and (2) impulsivity, which emerges from the interaction of extraversion and a second, independent trait (constraint). Agency is a more general motivational disposition that includes dominance, ambition, mastery, efficacy, and achievement. Positive affect (a combination of positive feelings and motivation) is closely associated with extraversion. Extraversion is accordingly based on positive incentive motivation. Parallels between extraversion (particularly its agency component) and a mammalian behavioral approach system based on positive incentive motivation implicate a neuroanatomical network and modulatory neurotransmitters in the processing of incentive motivation. A corticolimbic-striatal-thalamic network (1) integrates the salient incentive context in the medial orbital cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus; (2) encodes the intensity of incentive stimuli in a motive circuit composed of the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental area dopamine projection system; and (3) creates an incentive motivational state that can be transmitted to the motor system. Individual differences in the functioning of this network arise from functional variation in the ventral tegmental area dopamine projections, which are directly involved in coding the intensity of incentive motivation. The animal evidence suggests that there are three neurodevelopmental sources of individual differences in dopamine: genetic, "experience-expectant," and "experience-dependent." Individual differences in dopamine promote variation in the heterosynaptic plasticity that enhances the connection between incentive context and incentive motivation and behavior. Our psychobiological threshold model explains the effects of individual differences in dopamine transmission on behavior, and their relation to personality traits is discussed.},

In this Festschrift, I trace the theoretical development of Gray's approach--now known as Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory ({RST})--out of the Eysenckian tradition to its most recent articulation. Experimental attempts to test {RST} are reviewed and the theoretical problems raised by this literature discussed. Also presented are data relating to a recent clarification of {RST}, viz. the joint subsystems hypothesis, which postulates a fundamental interdependence of appetitive and aversive systems in the typical human laboratory. The value of Gray's general approach to building behavioural theories on the bases of both the conceptual nervous system and the real nervous system is validated in personality, which has long been thought a philosophical mystery rather than a standard problem to be tackled by scientific method.},

Lehren im Feld von erfahrenen Rollenträgerinnen und -trägern, oder salopper ausgedrückt: von Profi s, ist in hohem Maße ein gegenseitiges Lernen und ein gemeinsames Schärfen des Blickes, wie Th eorien und Konzepte mit berufl icher Praxis zusammengehen können. Wir bedanken uns deshalb in allererster Linie bei unseren Absolventinnen und Absolventen und bei unseren derzeitigen Teilnehmenden dafür, dass sie für die Professionalisierung in ihrem Arbeitsfeld das {IAP} als Lernstätte ausgewählt und mit uns und unseren Vorgängern diesen Austausch gepfl egt haben und es noch tun. Viele Beitragsautorinnen und -autoren dozieren und beraten ebenfalls unter dem Dach des {IAP}. Ihnen und den »externen« Autorinnen und Autoren dieses Buches sei herzlichst für ihre Bereitschaſt zur Mitarbeit gedankt und natürlich dafür, dass sie diese Bereitschaſt in guter Zusammenarbeit eingelöst haben. Vielen Dank dem Springer-Verlag und dort namentlich Herrn Coch, dem Programmplaner, und Herrn Barton, dem Projektmanager, für ihre ideelle Unterstützung und pragmatische Betreuung über eine sehr lange Zeitspanne hinweg sowie Herrn Blasig für seine aufmerksame und hilfreiche Lektoratsarbeit.

	abstract = {Die Bedeutung von Optionsstress und Zeitdruck in der modernen Arbeitswelt wird erörtert. Von Optionsstress wird gesprochen, wenn eine Person in einer Situation, die sich durch viele oder komplexe Optionen auszeichnet, zur Einschätzung gelangt, dass diese Situation ihre Ressourcen beansprucht oder übersteigt und ihr Wohlbefinden gefährdet. Optionsstress wird als ein Grundproblem des Menschen dargestellt, das durch die Modernisierung der Gesellschaft an Bedeutung gewinnt. Des Weiteren wird die These einer zweigeteilten Arbeitswelt entfaltet: In der strukturierten Arbeitswelt werden standardisierte Aufgaben in strukturierter Form abgearbeitet, so dass Optionsmangel das vorherrschende Merkmal ist. Die unstrukturierte Arbeitswelt zeichnet sich hingegen durch geringe Standardisierung, geringe Formalisierung und wenig festes Wissen sowie große Optionsräume aus. Konsequenzen dieser Zweiteilung für die Wissensarbeiter und andere Arbeitstätige werden verdeutlicht. In der Folge werden zum Verhältnis zwischen Optionsstress und Zeitdruck zwei Thesen aufgestellt: Optionslast führt zu Zeitdruck, Zeitdruck führt zu Optionsstress. Zur Eindämmumg von Optionsstress werden drei Maßnahmen genannt: (1) individuelles Training der Fähigkeit zu Optionsstressreduktion und Mehroptionsfähigkeit, (2) Strategien der sozialen Entscheidungsentlastung und (3) Strategien der sozialen Optionsreduktion.},

The reliability of the newly operationalized item list was tested with a cross-sectional study with repeated measurements. {RESULTS} The item writing process resulted in 94 dichotomous and 30 polytomous items. Data were collected in a convenience sample of 28 patients with neurological, musculoske-letal, cardiopulmonary, or internal organ conditions, requiring physical therapy in an acute hospital. Fifty-six percent of the polytomous and 68\% of the dichotomous items had a raw agreement of 0.7 or above, whereas 36\% of all polytomous and 34\% of all dichotomous items had a kappa coefficient of 0.7 and above. {CONCLUSION} The study supports that the {ICF} is adaptable to professional and setting-specific needs of physiotherapists. Further research towards the development of reliable instruments for physiotherapists based on the {ICF} seems justified. :},

	abstract = {Aspects of the female body may be attractive because they signal evolutionary fitness. Greater body fatness might reflect greater potential to survive famines, but individuals carrying larger fat stores may have poor health and lower fertility in non-famine conditions. A mathematical statistical model using epidemiological data linking fatness to fitness traits, predicted a peaked relationship between fatness and attractiveness (maximum at body mass index ({BMI}) = 22.8 to 24.8 depending on ethnicity and assumptions). Participants from three Caucasian populations (Austria, Lithuania and the {UK}), three Asian populations (China, Iran and Mauritius) and four African populations (Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria and Senegal) rated attractiveness of a series of female images varying in fatness ({BMI}) and waist to hip ratio ({WHR}). There was an inverse linear relationship between physical attractiveness and body fatness or {BMI} in all populations. Lower body fat was more attractive, down to at least {BMI} = 19. There was no peak in the relationship over the range we studied in any population. {WHR} was a significant independent but less important factor, which was more important (greater r2) in African populations. Predictions based on the fitness model were not supported. Raters appeared to use body fat percentage ({BF}\%) and {BMI} as markers of age. The covariance of {BF}\% and {BMI} with age indicates that the role of body fatness alone, as a marker of attractiveness, has been overestimated.},

Consequently, instructors teaching a methods course are often left with few supporting examples of published studies employing different research designs to discuss and analyze in class. We designed this resource to support students actively learning methodology in the classroom by providing instructors with an annotated bibliography of contemporary research to illustrate various research design elements in the context of topics that students will find engaging. Instructors can assign these articles as supplementary readings in order to provide a foundation for class discussion, activities, and critical thinking exercises. To facilitate this, each bibliographic entry includes in-class discussions starters that promote critical thinking as well as activities that use the research article as a foundation for developing new research questions and designs. The articles we selected for this resource illustrate various research designs as well as serve as examples of specific design features such as inter-rater reliability, the use of confederates, and other methods utilized in a variety of subject areas (e.g., sensation/perception, health psychology, social psychology, and neuroscience). We have also identified the statistical analyses used in each article so that instructors could use this resource in a statistics course.},

We determined the effect of reducing items from each domain (dyspnea, fatigue, emotion and mastery) of the 20-item Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire ({CRQ}). Three randomized trials of respiratory rehabilitation provided data. We removed items one at a time from each domain in three orders: by item impact, item responsiveness, and at random. Responsiveness, test-retest reliability and construct validity were evaluated at each step. Responsiveness and reliability, evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficients ({ICC}), were reduced marginally as the number of items was reduced to two items per domain. The deterioration was greatest when reducing from two items to one. To detect a particular effect, sample size would increase by about 10\% when reducing the number of items in a domain to 2. Construct validity showed a more marked deterioration. Reducing to two items per domain would maintain responsiveness and reliability of the {CRQ} at an acceptable level, with a trade-off of reduced construct validity and increase in sample size requirements.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to develop and validate a self-completed questionnaire, the Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool ({FiRST}), for the detection of fibromyalgia syndrome in patients with diffuse chronic pain. Items requiring "yes/no" responses and relating to the most relevant clinical characteristics of fibromyalgia were compiled by a group of rheumatologists and pain experts. The provisional questionnaire was tested in a prospective multicenter study of 162 patients with chronic pain due to fibromyalgia (according to {ACR} criteria) (n=92) compared with a group of patients with chronic diffuse pain due to other rheumatic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (n=32), ankylosing spondylitis (n=25) and osteoarthritis (n=13). Identification of the most discriminant combinations of items for fibromyalgia and the calculation of their sensitivity and specificity were based on both univariate and multivariate (stepwise logistic regression) analyses. The assessment of the psychometric properties of the questionnaire also dealt with face validity, content validity, test-retest reliability and convergent/divergent validity. Based on univariate and multivariate analyses, we retained only six items in the final version of {FiRST}. These items were used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the questionnaire. A cut-off score of 5 (corresponding to the number of positive items) gave the highest rate of correct identification of patients (87.9\%), with a sensitivity of 90.5\% and a specificity of 85.7\%. In conclusion, {FiRST} is a brief, simple and straightforward self-administered questionnaire with excellent discriminative value, of potential value for the detection of fibromyalgia in both daily practice and clinical research.},

	issn = {0419-4217},
	abstract = {A study by Jaeggi and her colleagues (2008) claimed that they were able to improve fluid intelligence (gf) by training working memory. Subjects who trained their working memory on a dual n-back task for a period of time showed significant improvements in working memory span tasks and fluid intelligence tests such as the Raven's Progressive Matrices and the Bochumer Matrices Test ({BOMAT}) after training compared to those without training. The current study aimed to replicate and extend the original study conducted by Jaeggi et al. (2008) in a well-controlled experiment that could explain the cause or causes of such transfer if indeed the case. There were a total of 93 participants who completed the study, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups---a passive control group, active control group and experimental group. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to the 8-day condition and the other half to the 20-day condition. All participants completed a battery of tests at pre- and post-tests that consisted of short timed tests, a complex working memory span and a matrix reasoning task. Participants in the active control group practiced for either 8 days or 20 days on the same task as the one used in the experimental group, the dual n-back, but at the easiest level to control for Hawthorne effect. Results from the current study did not suggest any significant improvement in the mental abilities tested, especially fluid intelligence and working memory capacity, after training for 8 days or 20 days. This leads to the conclusion that increasing one's working memory capacity by training and practice did not transfer to improvement on fluid intelligence as asserted by Jaeggi and her colleagues (2008, 2010).

	abstract = {Mindfulness is conceived as a state in which the individual pays full attention to everything that is happening around him or her. The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ({MAAS}) is the most popular instrument for assessing mindfulness. Studies on its structure have shown some conflicting results. This study aims to offer new evidence on the dimensionality and reliability of the {MAAS}, handling both {SEM} and {IRT} procedures, in palliative professionals. The sample was composed of 385 professionals from a national online survey. First, two Confirmatory Factor Analyses ({CFAs}) were specified, estimated, and tested, with one- and two-factor structures, respectively. Second, the Graded Response Model ({GRM}) was used and accuracy of the {MAAS} using information functions was estimated. Results showed appropriate fit for the two {CFA} models. As the correlation between the two factors in the two-factor model was extremely high and the original authors posited a one-factor solution, this structure was retained for parsimony. The {GRM} also supported this structure, but found that the scale offered more information on professionals with lower levels of mindfulness, pointing at items 1, 2, 6, and 15 as the less discriminative, in line with the {CFA} lower factor loadings for these very same items.

	abstract = {{STUDY} {DESIGN}: Randomized controlled trial, {OBJECTIVES}: To compare changes in shoulder internal rotation range of motion ({ROM}), for 2 stretching exercises, the "cross-body stretch" and the "sleeper stretch," in individuals with posterior shoulder tightness. {BACKGROUND}: Recently, some authors have expressed the belief that the sleeper stretch is better than the cross-body stretch to address glenohumeral posterior tightness because the scapula is stabilized. {METHODS}: Fifty-four asymptomatic subjects (20 males, 34 females) participated in the study. The control group (n=24) consisted of subjects with a between-shoulder difference in internal rotation {ROM} of less than 10 degrees, whereas those subjects with more than a 10 degrees difference were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 intervention groups, the sleeper stretch group (n=15) or the cross-body stretch group (n=15). Shoulder internal rotation {ROM}, with the arm abducted to 90 degrees and scapula motion prevented, was measured before and after a 4-week intervention period. Subjects in the control group were asked not to engage in any new stretching activities, while subjects in the 2 stretching groups were asked to perform stretching exercises on the more limited side only, once daily for 5 repetitions, holding each stretch for 30 seconds. {RESULTS}: The improvements in internal rotation {ROM} for the subjects in the cross-body stretch group (mean +/- {SD}, 20.0 degrees +/- 12.9 degrees) were significantly greater than for the subjects in the control group (5.9 degrees +/- 9.4 degrees, P = .009). The gains in the sleeper stretch group (12.4 degrees +/- 10.4 degrees) were not significant compared to those of the control group (P = .586) and those of the cross-body stretch group (P = .148). {CONCLUSIONS}: The cross-body stretch in individuals with limited shoulder internal rotation {ROM} appears to be more effective than no stretching in controls without internal rotation asymmetry to improve shoulder internal rotation {ROM}. While the improvement in internal rotation from the cross-body stretch was greater than for the sleeper stretch and of a magnitude that could be clinically significant, the small sample size likely precluded statistical significance between groups.},

Second, we critically analyze the relationships between the {ICNP} axes and terminology model components used to formally define procedures (including nursing actions) in {SNOMED} {RT}. Our findings demonstrate that the semantic categories represented by the {ICNP} intervention axes are relevant sources for terminology model components for nursing actions. In addition, our findings suggest that only minimal additions or extensions to the current semantic links of {SNOMED} {RT} are needed to support the formal definition of nursing actions such as those contained in {PCDS} and {HHCC}.},

This development can also be observed for the Socio-Economic Panel ({SOEP}) survey, which in recent years has also been expanded to include several psy- chological indicators. The Machiavellianism and Egoism Scales were integrated into the 2006 {SOEP} Pretest, which was carried out in preparation for future waves of the main survey, pro- viding the opportunity to test two more individual values relevant to action for their applica- bility to the {SOEP} standard battery of questions. The goal is to generate short item scales on the basis of established inventories that meet psychometric standards and are also connected with everyday action indicators. The three-item inventories developed display only moderate internal coherence but show the intended factor structure. Additionally, the short scales are also able to replicate the results of the original inventories. All in all, there is little evidence that the preferences under study are connected with socio-demographic characteristics; rather, they can be linked to personality indicators. Overall, we can observe the assumed connections to everyday life indicators in the expected direction, but their validity is limited by the size of the effect.},

We implemented an {ICNP} browser and we integrated it into two different systems: the nursing electronic patient record and the nursing protocols editor. The former allows nurses to choose {ICNP} terms for filling the clinical chart, while the latter allows computerising protocols using {ICNP} terms for the actions specification. Since, in a nursing information system, it should be worth to integrate protocols with the electronic patient record, sharing the same terminology is a crucial issue. We also show how we tailored the information system to the different wards. For each ward, we devised the most frequent patient needs and nursing actions. These lists are used to customise the different interfaces. Finally, by testing the prototype using real-world documents (clinical charts and protocols), we carried out an evaluation of the terminology itself, about its completeness and usability.},

Data were collected based on 52 records of nursing visits, realized from October 2001 to December 2002. To conduct the cross-mapping process, all identified nursing phenomena were joined, organized and compared according to the {ICNP}'s terms. Of the 51 identified nursing phenomena/diagnoses, 46 (90.2\%) showed exact and partial concordance. The identified nursing phenomena can be used to assist nurses to provide care for clients in family planning services. The {ICNP} showed to be a comprehensive program, although some terms need to be reviewed and others enhanced. However, considering that it is an international classification applicable to several countries, the mapping process and cross-references were very satisfactory.},

The effects of catastrophic thinking likely rely not only on the content or frequency of the thoughts, but also on other cognitive, behavioral, and environmental influences that are present. One possible influence is acceptance, which involves experiencing thoughts, moods, or sensations without some of their supplemental psychological effects on behavior, especially when these effects can contribute to less freedom in daily functioning. Design: The present study sought to explore how acceptance influenced the relations between catastrophizing and patient functioning in 344 individuals with chronic pain. Main Outcome Measures: Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophizing Scale. Results: Analyses indicated that acceptance mediated the effects of catastrophic thinking on depression, anxiety and avoidance, and physical and psychosocial functioning with indirect effect tests suggesting that the variance in functioning predicted by catastrophizing was significantly reduced with the inclusion of acceptance. Conclusion: These results suggest that research and clinical work in the area may benefit from a broadened perspective where the occurrence of catastrophic thinking is considered within the wider context of the behavioral processes that give this thinking its impact.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The age-related deterioration of physiological capacities such as muscle strength and balance is associated with increased dependence. Understanding the contribution of physical fitness components to functional performance facilitates the development of adequate exercise interventions aiming at preservation of function and independence of older people. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between physical fitness components and functional performance in older people living in long-term care facilities. {METHODS}: Design cross-sectional study. Subjects 226 persons living in long-term care facilities (mean age: 81.6 +/- 5.6). Outcome measures Physical fitness and functional performance were measured by performance-based tests. {RESULTS}: Knee and elbow extension strength were significantly higher in men (difference = 44.5 and 50.0 N, respectively), whereas women were more flexible (difference sit \& reach test = 7.2 cm). Functional performance was not significantly different between the genders. In men, motor coordination (eye-hand coordination) and measures of strength were the main contributors to functional performance, whereas in women flexibility (sit and reach test) and motor coordination (tandem stance and eye-hand coordination) played a major role. {CONCLUSION}: The results of this study show that besides muscle strength, fitness components such as coordination and flexibility are associated with functional performance of older people living in long-term care facilities. This suggests that men and women living in long-term care facilities, differ considerably concerning the fitness factors contributing to functional performance. Women and men may, therefore, need exercise programs emphasizing different fitness aspects in order to improve functional performance.},

	title = {Development of terminology subsets using {ICNP}},
	volume = {79},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE} For healthcare terminologies to provide coverage of a domain, many have evolved into very large and complex sets, creating a challenge for implementation. The International Classification of Nursing Practice ({ICNP}) Version 2 has over 2800 concepts. Thus, development of terminology subsets is considered as a potential solution to facilitate implementation. {METHOD} Based on early efforts to develop {ICNP} Catalogues, or clinically relevant subsets of the terminology, a process model was developed based on the {ICNP} life cycle. The steps involved in developing a subset are (a) identifying client(s) and health priority, (b) gathering terms and concepts relevant to a given priority, (c) mapping the identified concepts to the {ICNP} terminology, (d) modeling new concepts, (e) finalizing a Catalogue, and (f) disseminating the Catalogue. {RESULTS} The {ICNP} model was applied to subset development resulting in three {ICNP} Catalogues: (a) Partnering with Patients and Families to Promote Adherence to Treatment, (b) Palliative Care for Dignified Dying, and (c) Canadian Health Outcomes for Better Information and Care. Although the three Catalogues were very different in the focus of health priority addressed, there are overlapping concepts across the Catalogues ranging from 1.0 to 14.2\%. {CONCLUSION} The {ICNP} process model for Catalogue development can be used by other terminology developers and potentially assist in the creation of subset of {ICNP} to be used at the electronic health record interface. Further research is needed to address challenges and implications for testing and applications of terminology subsets.},

	volume = {9},
	abstract = {A double blind clinical trial was performed on 50 persons (25 men, 25 women) over the age 60 (average age: 77 years). They suffered from dementias of medium level ({DSM} {III}, Category 1, {ICD} No. 299), and had been residents in an old age home longer than 3 months at the start of the trial. The patients were treated first for 2 weeks by placebo tablets and their initial performance was recorded during this period by using the Nuremberg Gerontopsychological Inventory ({NAI}). This was then followed by a treatment for 8 weeks with the nootropic drug, centrophenoxine ({CPH}), the dose of which was 2 g/day distributed in 2 x 2 tablets of Helfergin500 (Promonta, Hamburg, {FRG}), or with placebo tablets of identical size, then the {NAI} test was repeated again. Verum or placebo treatment was selected randomly and the code was revealed only after having elaborated all the results of the trial. During the treatment period four drop-outs occurred for intercurrent diseases. Evaluation was based on a semi-quantitative, intra-individual comparison of the performance before and after treatment. The results obtained suggest that {CPH} treatment may be useful in dementias of medium level in quite old groups of patients, since 48\% of the verum group displayed improvements in the memory functions against 28\% of the placebo group. {CPH} seems to be a useful and harmless drug in the treatment and most probably also in prevention of the dementias.},

This inference has been a feature of psychometrics since early last century, before which it permeated scientific thought and played a role in the development of psychophysics. Despite this, its cogency has been analysed only rarely. Elsewhere, I have argued that it is not deductively valid, a point that might be considered obvious except that attempts have been made to show otherwise. Its invalidity displayed, it is easily shown that it is not inductively reasonable either. However, it might still be urged that the inference from order to quantity is an inference to the best explanation: that is, that quantitative structure is reasonably abduced from order. I argue that the opposite is true: the most plausible hypothesis is that the sorts of attributes psychometricians aspire to measure are merely ordinal attributes with impure differences of degree, a feature logically incompatible with quantitative structure. If so, psychometrics is built upon a myth.},

The criterion for selecting candidate categories for the brief {ICF} Core Sets was based on their ability to discriminate between patients with high or low functioning status. Discrimination was assessed using multivariable regression models, the independent variables being all of the {ICF} categories of the respective comprehensive {ICF} Core Set. Analogue ratings of overall functioning as reported by patients and health professionals were used as dependent variables. {RESULTS} A total of 391 patients were included in the study (91 neurological, 109 cardiopulmonary, 191 musculoskeletal), mean age 63.4 years, 50.1\% female. Selection yielded 33 cate-gories for neurological, 31 for cardiopulmonary, and 30 for musculoskeletal. {CONCLUSION} The present selection of categories can be considered an initial proposal, serving to identify the {ICF} cate-gories most relevant for the practical assessment and monitoring of functioning in patients with acute neurological, cardiopulmonary, and musculoskeletal conditions.},

	abstract = {In six experiments we show that initial valuations of familiar products and simple hedonic experiences are strongly influenced by arbitrary 'anchors' (sometimes derived from a person's social security number). Because subsequent valuations are also coherent with respect to salient differences in perceived quality or quantity of these products and experiences, the entire pattern of valuations can easily create an illusion of order, as if it is being generated by stable underlying preferences. The experiments show that this combination of coherent arbitrariness (1) cannot be interpreted as a rational response to information, (2) does not decrease as a result of experience with a good, (3) is not necessarily reduced by market forces, and (4) is not unique to cash prices. The results imply that demand curves estimated from market data need not reveal true consumer preferences, in any normatively significant sense of the term. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Knowledge concerning the applicability and the effect of high-intensity exercise programs is very limited for older people with severe cognitive and physical impairments. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of a high-intensity functional weight-bearing exercise program among older people who are dependent in activities of daily living and living in residential care facilities. A second aim was to analyze whether cognitive function was associated with the applicability of the program. {SUBJECTS}: The subjects were 91 older people (mean age=85.3 years, {SD}=6.1, range=68-100) who were dependent in personal activities of daily living and randomly assigned to participate in an exercise intervention. Their mean score for the Mini-Mental State Examination ({MMSE}) was 17.5 ({SD}=5.0, range=10-29). {METHODS}: A high-intensity functional weight-bearing exercise program was performed in groups of 3 to 7 participants who were supervised by physical therapists. There were 29 exercise sessions over 13 weeks. Attendance, intensity of lower-limb strength and balance exercises, and occurrence and seriousness of adverse events were the outcome variables in evaluating the applicability of the program. {RESULTS}: The median attendance rate was 76\%. Lower-limb strength exercises with high intensity were performed in a median of 53\% of the attended exercise sessions, and balance exercises with high intensity were performed in a median of 73\% of the attended exercise sessions. The median rate of sessions with adverse events was 5\%. All except 2 adverse events were assessed as minor and temporary, and none led to manifest injury or disease. No significant differences were observed in applicability when comparing participants with dementia and participants without dementia. In addition, there was no significant correlation between applicability and the {MMSE} score. {DISCUSSION} {AND} {CONCLUSION}: The results suggest that a high-intensity functional weight-bearing exercise program is applicable for use, regardless of cognitive function, among older people who are dependent in activities of daily living, living in residential care facilities, and have an {MMSE} score of 10 or higher.},

For the {ICF} components Body Functions, Body Structures and Activities and Participation, absolute and relative frequencies of impairments/limitations in the study population were reported. For the component Environmental Factors absolute and relative frequencies of perceived barriers or facilitators were reported. {RESULTS} The mean age in the sample was 79.9 years. Sixty-nine percent of the patients were female. In 150 patients, 82 {ICF} categories (34\%) had a prevalence of 30\% or above. The 82 categories included 22 categories (45\%) of the component Body Functions, six categories (15\%) of the component Body Structures, 25 categories (34\%) of the component Activities and Participation and 29 (57\%) categories of the component Environmental Factors. {CONCLUSION} This study is a first step towards the development of {ICF} Core Sets for geriatric patients in early post-acute rehabilitation facilities.},

In this predicament it has been observed that minimal requests, while serving to make a target person's compliance highly likely, also tend to produce low-level payoffs for the requester. A procedure was developed to avoid the dilemma by legitimizing, rather than requesting, the delivery of a minimal favor. It was predicted that a solicitor who implied that a very small favor was acceptable, but not necessarily desirable, would make it difficult for a target to decline to help and, at the same time, make it unlikely that the target would actually offer a low grade of assistance. In confirmation of this prediction, a door-to-door solicitor for charity was able to increase significantly the frequency of donations while leaving unaffected the size of the donations by adding the sentence, "Even a penny will help," to a standard request for funds. Exp {II} replicated this result and provided evidence for the legitimization-of-small-favors explanation of the effect.},

	title = {Primary total knee arthroplasty in patients with fixed valgus deformity},
	abstract = {Ninety-nine knees in 81 patients evaluated from two to ten years and having enough valgus deformity to require specific soft-tissue release were studied. They were also compared to a control group of 40 knees in 31 patients with no angular deformity greater than 5 degrees, who were matched for age and diagnosis. All procedures were performed using a minimally constrained, posterior-cruciate-ligament-sparing prosthesis. Pre- and postoperative axial alignment was measured on weight-bearing long-standing roentgenographs. Analysis included examination for lucent lines in postoperative fluoroscopically positioned roentgenographs and clinical data summarized using the 100-point scoring systems developed by The Knee Society. Knees were classified as having Type I, {II}, or {III} valgus deformities: Type I was defined as valgus deformity secondary to bone loss in the lateral compartment and soft-tissue contracture with medial soft tissues intact; Type {II} was defined as obvious attenuation of the medial capsular ligament complex; and Type {III} was defined as severe valgus deformity with valgus malpositioning of the proximal tibial joint line after overcorrected proximal tibial osteotomy. Only cases of Type I and Type {II} were represented in the 99 knees reported. Type I patients were treated with lateral soft-tissue release, and Type {II} patients were treated with medial capsular ligament tightening (i.e., ligament reconstruction procedures on the medial side). The Knee Society postoperative knee score was 87.6 (+/- 10.6) and mean postoperative functional score was 52.3. Alignment was well corrected and knee scores for the Type I and {II} groups were almost identical as were the functional scores. The results were grouped as 72\% excellent, 18\% good, 7\% fair, and 2\% poor. Notably, the control group was 39 of 40 patients excellent, and only one poor. Ligament stability was satisfactorily established by lateral release in Type I and with the combined medial plication in the Type {II} patients. The ligament-tightening procedures were on the average 40 minutes longer than those for the Type I or the control groups. The controversial nature of the simultaneous ligament reconstruction method is recognized, but good experience is reported.},

The core of {ICNP} Version 1 is represented in the Web Ontology Language, the de facto standard ontology representation language. An ontology editor, Protégé, and other software tools have been used to support the process. The result is a robust terminological resource that can accommodate existing and emerging nursing terminologies and allow comparisons to be made between disparate nursing data.

Patients completed headache diaries from 4 weeks before to 12 weeks after randomization and from week 21 to 24 after randomization.Main Outcome Measures Difference in headache days of moderate or severe intensity between the 4 weeks before and weeks 9 to 12 after randomization.Results Between baseline and weeks 9 to 12, the mean ({SD}) number of days with headache of moderate or severe intensity decreased by 2.2 (2.7) days from a baseline of 5.2 (2.5) days in the acupuncture group compared with a decrease to 2.2 (2.7) days from a baseline of 5.0 (2.4) days in the sham acupuncture group, and by 0.8 (2.0) days from a baseline if 5.4 (3.0) days in the waiting list group. No difference was detected between the acupuncture and the sham acupuncture groups (0.0 days, 95\% confidence interval, −0.7 to 0.7 days; P = .96) while there was a difference between the acupuncture group compared with the waiting list group (1.4 days; 95\% confidence interval; 0.8-2.1 days; P{\textless}.001). The proportion of responders (reduction in headache days by at least 50\%) was 51\% in the acupuncture group, 53\% in the sham acupuncture group, and 15\% in the waiting list group.Conclusion Acupuncture was no more effective than sham acupuncture in reducing migraine headaches although both interventions were more effective than a waiting list control.},

	abstract = {Context Primary care physicians report high levels of distress, which is linked to burnout, attrition, and poorer quality of care. Programs to reduce burnout before it results in impairment are rare; data on these programs are scarce.Objective To determine whether an intensive educational program in mindfulness, communication, and self-awareness is associated with improvement in primary care physicians' well-being, psychological distress, burnout, and capacity for relating to patients.Design, Setting, and Participants Before-and-after study of 70 primary care physicians in Rochester, New York, in a continuing medical education ({CME}) course in 2007-2008. The course included mindfulness meditation, self-awareness exercises, narratives about meaningful clinical experiences, appreciative interviews, didactic material, and discussion. An 8-week intensive phase (2.5 h/wk, 7-hour retreat) was followed by a 10-month maintenance phase (2.5 h/mo).Main Outcome Measures Mindfulness (2 subscales), burnout (3 subscales), empathy (3 subscales), psychosocial orientation, personality (5 factors), and mood (6 subscales) measured at baseline and at 2, 12, and 15 months.Results Over the course of the program and follow-up, participants demonstrated improvements in mindfulness (raw score, 45.2 to 54.1; raw score change [Δ], 8.9; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 7.0 to 10.8); burnout (emotional exhaustion, 26.8 to 20.0; Δ = −6.8; 95\% {CI}, −4.8 to −8.8; depersonalization, 8.4 to 5.9; Δ = −2.5; 95\% {CI}, −1.4 to −3.6; and personal accomplishment, 40.2 to 42.6; Δ = 2.4; 95\% {CI}, 1.2 to 3.6); empathy (116.6 to 121.2; Δ = 4.6; 95\% {CI}, 2.2 to 7.0); physician belief scale (76.7 to 72.6; Δ = −4.1; 95\% {CI}, −1.8 to −6.4); total mood disturbance (33.2 to 16.1; Δ = −17.1; 95\% {CI}, −11 to −23.2), and personality (conscientiousness, 6.5 to 6.8; Δ = 0.3; 95\% {CI}, 0.1 to 5 and emotional stability, 6.1 to 6.6; Δ = 0.5; 95\% {CI}, 0.3 to 0.7). Improvements in mindfulness were correlated with improvements in total mood disturbance (r = −0.39, P {\textless} .001), perspective taking subscale of physician empathy (r = 0.31, P {\textless} .001), burnout (emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment subscales, r = −0.32 and 0.33, respectively; P {\textless} .001), and personality factors (conscientiousness and emotional stability, r = 0.29 and 0.25, respectively; P {\textless} .001).Conclusions Participation in a mindful communication program was associated with short-term and sustained improvements in well-being and attitudes associated with patient-centered care. Because before-and-after designs limit inferences about intervention effects, these findings warrant randomized trials involving a variety of practicing physicians.},

A convenience sample of 56 patient records with data on nutrition and skin care was analyzed and mapped to the {ICNP}. {FINDINGS} Using the {ICNP} terminology, 59\%-62\% of the record content describing nursing phenomena and 30\%-44\% of the nursing interventions in the areas of nutrition and skin care could be expressed satisfactorily. For about a quarter of the content describing nursing phenomena and interventions, no corresponding {ICNP} term was found. {CONCLUSIONS} The {ICNP} needs to be further developed to allow representation of the entire range of nursing care. Terms need to be developed to express patient participation and preferences, normal conditions, qualitative dimensions and characteristics, nonhuman focus, and duration. {PRACTICE} {IMPLICATIONS} The practical usefulness of the {ICNP} needs further testing before conclusions about its clinical benefits can be determined.},

Design Prospective, population based study with four years of follow up. Setting City of Leiden, the Netherlands. Participants 500 people aged 85 years at recruitment. Main outcome measures Annual assessments of depressive symptoms (15 item geriatric depression scale), global cognitive function (mini-mental state examination), attention (Stroop test), processing speed (letter digit coding test), and immediate and delayed recall (12 word learning test). Results At 85 years old, participants\&\#039; depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment were highly significantly correlated (P \&lt; 0.001). During follow up, an accelerated annual increase of depressive symptoms was associated with impaired attention (0.08 points (95\% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.16)), immediate recall (0.17 points (0.09 to 0.25)), and delayed recall (0.10 points (0.02 to 0.18)) at baseline. In contrast, depressive symptoms at baseline were not related to an accelerated cognitive decline during follow up (P \&gt; 0.05). Conclusion Caregivers should be aware of the development of depressive symptoms when cognitive impairment is present. However, the presence of depression only does not increase the risk of cognitive decline. Footnotes

	volume = {53},
	abstract = {Background: Slowing of motor movements in human aging is a well-known occurrence, but its biologic basis is poorly understood. Reliable quantitation may refine observations of this phenomenon to better aid research on this entity.Methods: A panel equipped with timing sensors under computer control was used to measure upper extremity movement times in two groups of healthy individuals: adults younger than 60 years of age (n = 56; range, 18--58 years) and adults older than 60 years of age (n = 38; range, 61--94 years).Results: Fine motor performance was better in the dominant hand (p = 0.0007) regardless of age. Adult and aged groups differed on two basic timing measures, which reflect coarse motor and fine motor performance (p {\textless} 0.0001). There were no gender differences on either measure. There was a strong effect of task difficulty with age on coarse motor (p {\textless} 0.01) and fine motor (p {\textless} 0.0001) measures. The fine motor measure of hand performance in healthy individuals correlated in a nonlinear fashion with age for more difficult tasks (r2 = 0.63) but showed a simple linear relation for less-demanding tasks (r2 = 0.5).Conclusion: This technique sensitively detects age-related motor performance decline in humans. There may be a critical period in late midlife when fine motor performance decline either begins or abruptly worsens.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To develop Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Disease Damage Index ({SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI}) item weightings that improve the ability of the measure to predict patient mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus ({SLE}). {METHODS}: Disease damage was measured for 738 patients followed at the University of Toronto Lupus Clinic since diagnosis. Using Rasch analysis, item weightings were determined and tested for their ability to predict death in a logistic regression model. Receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curves were produced to compare the original and weighted scales' ability to discriminate patients that died during the followup period from those who remained alive. {RESULTS}: The average {SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI} score per patient was 1.66. In total, 138 of the patients died during a mean followup of 9.2 years. A Rasch analysis derived weighting scheme using weighted domain scores ({SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI}-weighted) was the best weighted scale, with item reliability = 94\%, model mean square infit = 1.01 ({STD} = 0.05); model mean square outfit = 0.99 ({STD} = 0.3), separation 4.08. The {SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI}-weighted was modestly better than the {SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI} in discriminating patients who died from those who remained alive. Using standardized scores for comparability, the {SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI}-weighted was better in predicting patient death than the unweighted {SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI} [{OR}(death)({SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI}-weighted) = 1.7 vs {OR}(death)({SLICC}-{ACR}-{DI}) = 1.4; p {\textless} 0.005]. {ROC} curve analysis supports that the {SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI}-weighted was somewhat superior to the {SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI} for predicting mortality. {CONCLUSION}: In this test set, the {SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI}-weighted was modestly better in predicting death than the traditional unweighted {SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI}. However, the {SLICC}/{ACR}-{DI}-weighted is more difficult to apply and the weightings appear not to have provided a clinically relevant improvement of the {SLICC}-{ACR}-{DI}.},

Three theories are identified: the representational, the operational, and the classical. In each case the relation between measurement scales and statistical procedures is explored. The representational theory implies a relation between measurement scales and statistics, though not the one mentioned by Stevens or his followers. The operational and classical theories, for different reasons, imply no relation between measurement scales and statistics, contradicting Stevens's prescriptions.

	volume = {73},
	abstract = {Background and Purpose. The purpose of this study was to document the prevalence, severity, and progression of knee flexion contractures ({KFCs}) in a population of institutionalized elderly and to identify relationships between knee extension and other variables. Subjects. The subjects were 112 nursing home residents who exhibited a broad range of ambulation and cognitive function abilities. Methods. Data were collected initially (T1) and after a 10-month period (T2). Results. Only 25\% of the population had extension in the 0- to 5-degree (lacking full extension) range bilaterally at T1 and T2, leaving the majority of subjects with some degree of unilateral {KFC}. Most of the subjects with a {KFC} greater than 20 degrees were nonambulatory and had a significantly higher occurrence of resistance to motion than did nonambulators with a {KFC} of less than 20 degrees. Knee extension measurements did not change in most subjects between T1 and T2. The knees that did show a change in {KFC} (either an increase or a decrease) had a significantly higher occurrence of resistance to passive motion than did other knees. Compared with the subjects who gained extension, the subjects who lost extension over the study period more frequently had minimal {KFC} at T1, were ambulatory at T1, showed a regression in ambulation at T2, and developed resistance to motion at T2. Conclusion and Discussion. The data confirmed significant positive correlations between degree of {KFC} and presence of resistance to passive knee motion, cognitive impairment, impaired ambulation, and presence of knee pain. Physical therapy assessment and intervention may be appropriate in nonambulatory nursing home residents with resistance to passive motion, residents with {KFC} approaching 20 degrees, and ambulatory residents with minimal {KFC} who develop resistance and begin to regress in ambulation. Several areas for future study are suggested.},

	abstract = {Classical factor analysis relies on the assumption of normally distributed factors that guarantees the model to be estimated via the maximum likelihood method. Even when the assumption of Gaussian factors is not explicitly formulated and estimation is performed via the iterated principal factors' method, the interest is actually mainly focussed on the linear structure of the data, since only moments up to the second ones are involved. In many real situations, the factors could not be adequately described by the first two moments only. For example, skewness characterizing most latent variables in social analysis can be properly measured by the third moment: the factors are not normally distributed and covariance is no longer a sufficient statistic. In this work we propose a factor model characterized by skew-normally distributed factors. Skew-normal refers to a parametric class of probability distributions, that extends the normal distribution by an additional shape parameter regulating the skewness. The model estimation can be solved by the generalized {EM} algorithm, in which the iterative Newthon-Raphson procedure is needed in the M-step to estimate the factor shape parameter. The proposed skew-normal factor analysis is applied to the study of student satisfaction towards university courses, in order to identify the factors representing different aspects of the latent overall satisfaction.},

	title = {Innovation und Kreativität 1 Definition von Innovation},
	abstract = {Ein geringes Wirtschaftswachstum, hohe Arbeitslosenzahlen sowie eine hohe Staatsverschuldung prägen zunehmend die Situation in den europäischen Industrienationen. Öffentliche und private Organisationen in den einzelnen Ländern sind dabei mit dem wachsenden internationalen Wettbewerb und den steigenden Ansprüchen der Kunden konfrontiert. In dieser Wettbewerbssituation verlieren die meisten Industrienationen täglich Arbeitsplätze, und zwar einfache wie komplexe, an so genannte Niedriglohnländer, wie z.B. die osteuropäischen Staaten, aber auch Indien, China etc. In Deutschland wanderten beispielsweise allein im Jahr 2003 pro Tag 1700 Arbeitsplätze in diese Länder ab. Insgesamt hat dies in Deutschland im Zeitraum von 1991 bis 2004 zu einem Verlust von nahezu zwei Millionen industriellen Arbeitsplätzen geführt. Dabei haben die Reduzierung von Personal und die Optimierung organisationsinterner Prozesse in den 90er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts oft nicht den gewünschten wirtschaftlichen Erfolg erzielt (Hamel \& Prahalad, 1994). Im Allgemeinen soll die Bewältigung dieser Herausforderungen durch neue oder optimierte Produkte erfolgen, die schneller auf den Markt gebracht werden, insgesamt sollen neue Märkte eröffnet und die Kundenbedürfnisse noch besser befriedigt werden. Dabei sollen die Kosten der Produkte durch die kontinuierliche Optimierung der Entwicklung, Produktion und des Vertriebs immer weiter abnehmen. Aus wirtschaftlicher Sicht können deshalb Innovationen lang anhaltende Vorteile im nationalen und internationalen Wettbewerb schaffen und für schnelles Wachstum verbunden mit hohen Gewinnen bei den jeweiligen Innovatoren sorgen. Die Kunden nehmen diese Entwicklung durch den starken Preisverfall bei gleichzeitiger Verbesserung der Produktqualität wahr. So kosteten die ersten kommerziellen Mikrowellenherde -- ursprünglich ein Produkt militärischer Radarforschung -- im Jahre 1947 noch stolze 5000 {US}-Dollar. Sie hatten eine Höhe von 1,55 m, ein Gewicht von 350 kg und sie mussten mit Wasser gekühlt werden. Heutzutage sind sie ab 50 Euro und in Größen erhältlich, die in jede Küche integriert werden können. Im Folgenden werden wir zunächst den Begriff der Innovation definieren, die},

	abstract = {The aims of this randomised controlled trial were to determine if a high-intensity functional exercise program improves balance, gait ability, and lower-limb strength in older persons dependent in activities of daily living and if an intake of protein-enriched energy supplement immediately after the exercises increases the effects of the training. One hundred and ninety-one older persons dependent in activities of daily living, living in residential care facilities, and with a Mini-Mental State Examination ({MMSE}) score of ? 10 participated. They were randomised to a high-intensity functional exercise program or a control activity, which included 29 sessions over 3 months, as well as to protein-enriched energy supplement or placebo. Berg Balance Scale, self-paced and maximum gait speed, and one-repetition maximum in lower-limb strength were followed-up at three and six months and analysed by 2 x 2 factorial {ANCOVA}, using the intention-to-treat principle. At three months, the exercise group had improved significantly in self-paced gait speed compared with the control group (mean difference 0.04 m/s, p = 0.02). At six months, there were significant improvements favouring the exercise group for Berg Balance Scale (1.9 points, p = 0.05), self-paced gait speed (0.05 m/s, p = 0.009), and lower-limb strength (10.8 kg, p = 0.03). No interaction effects were seen between the exercise and nutrition interventions. In conclusion, a high-intensity functional exercise program has positive long-term effects in balance, gait ability, and lower-limb strength for older persons dependent in activities of daily living. An intake of protein-enriched energy supplement immediately after the exercises does not appear to increase the effects of the training.},

            Voluntary acts are preceded by electrophysiological “readiness potentials” ({RPs}). With spontaneous acts involving no preplanning, the main negative {RP} shift begins at about—550 ms.

The time of conscious intention to act was obtained from the subject's recall of the spatial clock position of a revolving spot at the time of his initial awareness of intending or wanting to move (W). W occurred at about—200 ms. Control experiments, in which a skin stimulus was timed (S), helped evaluate each subject's error in reporting the clock times for awareness of any perceived event.
            For spontaneous voluntary acts, {RP} onset preceded the uncorrected Ws by about 350 ms and the Ws corrected for S by about 400 ms. The direction of this difference was consistent and significant throughout, regardless of which of several measures of {RP} onset or W were used. It was concluded that cerebral initiation of a spontaneous voluntary act begins unconsciously. However, it was found that the final decision to act could still be consciously controlled during the 150 ms or so remaining after the specific conscious intention appears. Subjects can in fact “veto” motor performance during a 100–200-ms period before a prearranged time to act.
            The role of conscious will would be not to initiate a specific voluntary act but rather to select and control volitional outcome. It is proposed that conscious will can function in a permissive fashion, either to permit or to prevent the motor implementation of the intention to act that arises unconsciously. Alternatively, there may be the need for a conscious activation or triggering, without which the final motor output would not follow the unconscious cerebral initiating and preparatory processes.},

	doi = {10.1055/s-0043-114004},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

Mindfulness recently attracted growing interest beyond classical therapeutic contexts and has been adopted in preventive labor contexts and occupational health. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a mobile mindfulness training app regarding work and health indicators.

{METHODS}

Participants were employees and assigned randomly to the intervention and control groups. 146 employed participants in the intervention group used the mobile application '7mind' for 14 days. Comparisons were made with 160 employed participants from the control group, who were given access to the app after finishing the study (wait-list control).

{RESULTS}

After two weeks of use, significant effects of the training were indicated by better results for the intervention group as compared to the control group. Some of the effect sizes can be considered as large: participants in the intervention group improved in measures of mindfulness, work engagement, job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, emotional intelligence, innovation and creativity, and self-efficacy.

{CONCLUSION}

Conventional mindfulness training programs are organized in groups. Our study demonstrates for the first time the effectiveness of a mobile mindfulness training app in the work context. The mobile app offers an easy and flexible access to training mindfulness and improving work and health-related indicators.

{ZIEL}: Das Konzept der Achtsamkeit findet aktuell eine große Beachtung und das nicht allein im therapeutischen Umfeld, sondern auch in präventiven beruflichen Kontexten. Die vorliegende Studie untersucht die Wirksamkeit eines appbasierten Achtsamkeitstrainings in Bezug auf arbeits- und gesundheitsrelevante Indikatoren bei Berufstätigen.

{METHODIK}

An der Studie nahmen Berufstätige teil, die randomisiert einer Interventions- und einer Wartegruppe zugeteilt wurden. 146 Berufstätige der Interventionsgruppe nutzten die mobile Applikation 7mind über einen Zeitraum von 14 Tagen. Verglichen wurden sie mit 160 Berufstätigen der Wartegruppe, die nach Abschluss der Studie ebenfalls Zugriff auf die App erhielten.

{ERGEBNISSE}

Im Vergleich zur Wartegruppe zeigen sich bei der Interventionsgruppe nach dem 2-wöchigen Training in allen untersuchten Bereichen positive (signifikante) Effekte, z.T. mit großen Effektstärken: Die Nutzer und Nutzerinnen weisen höhere Werte in Bezug auf Achtsamkeit, Arbeitsengagement, Arbeitszufriedenheit, emotionale Intelligenz, Innovation und Kreativität sowie Selbstwirksamkeit und geringere Werte in der emotionalen Erschöpfung auf.

{SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN}

Klassische Achtsamkeitstrainings werden in Form von Gruppenkursen durchgeführt. Die vorliegende Studie zeigt, dass auch ein appbasiertes Training bei Berufstätigen positive Effekte mit arbeits- und gesundheitsbezogener Relevanz erzielt. Die mobile App bietet damit einen einfachen und flexiblen Einstieg zur Stärkung von Achtsamkeit, auch unter präventiv- und arbeitsmedizinischen Gesichtspunkten.},

	volume = {56},
	abstract = {{AIM} This paper reports a systematic review on the outcomes of nursing diagnostics. Specifically, it examines effects on documentation of assessment quality; frequency, accuracy and completeness of nursing diagnoses; and on coherence between nursing diagnoses, interventions and outcomes. {BACKGROUND} Escalating healthcare costs demand the measurement of nursing's contribution to care. Use of standardized terminologies facilitates this measurement. Although several studies have evaluated nursing diagnosis documentation and their relationship with interventions and outcomes, a systematic review has not been carried out. {METHOD} A Medline, {CINAHL}, and Cochrane Database search (1982-2004) was conducted and enhanced by the addition of primary source and conference proceeding articles. Inclusion criteria were established and applied. Thirty-six articles were selected and subjected to thematic content analysis; each study was then assessed, and a level of evidence and grades of recommendations assigned. {FINDINGS} Nursing diagnosis use improved the quality of documented patient assessments (n = 14 studies), identification of commonly occurring diagnoses within similar settings (n = 10), and coherence among nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes (n = 8). Four studies employed a continuing education intervention and found statistically significant improvements in the documentation of diagnoses, interventions and outcomes. However, limitations in diagnostic accuracy, reporting of signs/symptoms, and aetiology were also reported (14 studies). One meta-analysis of eight trials including 1497 patients showed no evidence that standardized electronic documentation of nursing diagnosis and related interventions led to better nursing outcomes. {CONCLUSION} Despite variable results, the trend indicated that nursing diagnostics improved assessment documentation, the quality of interventions reported, and outcomes attained. The study reveals deficits in reporting of signs/symptoms and aetiology. Consequently, staff educational measures to enhance diagnostic accuracy are recommended. The relationships among diagnoses, interventions and outcomes require further evaluation. Studies are needed to determine the relationship between the quality of documentation and practice.},

	abstract = {Cannabis use initiated during adolescence might precipitate negative consequences in adulthood. Thus, predicting adolescent cannabis use prior to any exposure will inform the aetiology of substance abuse by disentangling predictors from consequences of use. In this prediction study, data were drawn from the {IMAGEN} sample, a longitudinal study of adolescence. All selected participants (n = 1,581) were cannabis-naïve at age 14. Those reporting any cannabis use (out of six ordinal use levels) by age 16 were included in the outcome group (N = 365, males n = 207). Cannabis-naïve participants at age 14 and 16 were included in the comparison group (N = 1,216, males n = 538). Psychosocial, brain and genetic features were measured at age 14 prior to any exposure. Cross-validated regularized logistic regressions for each use level by sex were used to perform feature selection and obtain prediction error statistics on independent observations. Predictors were probed for sex- and drug-specificity using post-hoc logistic regressions. Models reliably predicted use as indicated by satisfactory prediction error statistics, and contained psychosocial features common to both sexes. However, males and females exhibited distinct brain predictors that failed to predict use in the opposite sex or predict binge drinking in independent samples of same-sex participants. Collapsed across sex, genetic variation on catecholamine and opioid receptors marginally predicted use. Using machine learning techniques applied to a large multimodal dataset, we identified a risk profile containing psychosocial and sex-specific brain prognostic markers, which were likely to precede and influence cannabis initiation.},

We administered the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory ({FMI}) and the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills ({KIMS}) to a non-clinical sample of German adults (n= 211). {BIS} was measured using the Action Regulation Emotion System Questionnaire ({ARES}), and well-being was measured using a compound variable consisting of the Marburg Habitual Well-being Scale ({MHW}) along with two subscales of the Questionnaire of General Habitual Well-Being ({FAHW}). We analysed two mediator models with the {FMI} or {KIMS} as independent variables, respectively. In both models, {BIS} was modelled as a mediator, and well-being served as the dependent variable. The total effect of mindfulness on well-being was found to be strong for both models. Also, the effect of mindfulness on the proposed mediator {BIS} was substantial, as was the effect of {BIS} on well-being. The study demonstrates that {BIS} can partially explain the pathway between mindfulness and well-being, suggesting that {BIS} may be a mediator of the effects of mindfulness. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study examines the effects of puberty and sex on the intrinsic functional connectivity ({iFC}) of brain networks, with a focus on the default-mode network ({DMN}). Consistently implicated in depressive disorders, the {DMN}'s function may interact with puberty and sex in the development of these disorders, whose onsets peak in adolescence, and which show strong sex disproportionality (females  males). The main question concerns how the {DMN} evolves with puberty as a function of sex. These effects are expected to involve within- and between-network {iFC}, particularly, the salience and the central-executive networks, consistent with the Triple-Network Model. Resting-state scans of an adolescent community sample (n = 304, male/female: 157/147; mean/std age: 14.6/0.41 years), from the {IMAGEN} database, were analyzed using the {AFNI} software suite and a data reduction strategy for the effects of puberty and sex. Three midline regions (medial prefrontal, pregenual anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate), within the {DMN} and consistently implicated in mood disorders, were selected as seeds. Within- and between-network clusters of the {DMN} {iFC} changed with pubertal maturation differently in boys and girls (puberty-X-sex). Specifically, pubertal maturation predicted weaker {iFC} in girls and stronger {iFC} in boys. Finally, {iFC} was stronger in boys than girls independently of puberty. Brain-behavior associations indicated that lower connectivity of the anterior cingulate seed predicted higher internalizing symptoms at 2-year follow-up. In conclusion, weaker {iFC} of the anterior {DMN} may signal disconnections among circuits supporting mood regulation, conferring risk for internalizing disorders.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.bpsc.2019.02.006},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Studying the neural consequences of tobacco smoking during adolescence, including those associated with early light use, may help expose the mechanisms that underlie the transition from initial use to nicotine dependence in adulthood. However, only a few studies in adolescents exist, and they include small samples. In addition, the neural mechanism, if one exists, that links nicotinic receptor genes to smoking behavior in adolescents is still unknown.

{METHODS}

Structural and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from a large sample of 14-year-old adolescents who completed an extensive battery of neuropsychological, clinical, personality, and drug-use assessments. Additional assessments were conducted at 16 years of age.

{RESULTS}

Exposure to smoking in adolescents, even at low doses, is linked to volume changes in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and to altered neuronal connectivity in the corpus callosum. The longitudinal analyses strongly suggest that these effects are not preexisting conditions in those who progress to smoking. There was a genetic contribution wherein the volume reduction effects were magnified in smokers who were carriers of the high-risk genotype of the alpha 5 nicotinic receptor subunit gene, rs16969968.

{CONCLUSIONS}

These findings give insight into a mechanism involving genes, brain structure, and connectivity underlying why some adolescents find nicotine especially addictive.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The provision of healthcare has to take into consideration evidence-based results from valid and relevant studies; this principle is included in German social laws. The prescribing assessment scheme ({PAS}) of the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians contains a systematic appraisal of the benefit of drugs on the basis of their clinical evidence, their safety, and indications for their prescription.

{METHODS}

We analysed nationwide prescription data of physicians that have contractual relationships with statutory health insurance funds in 2014. The drugs have been classified on the basis of their clinical evidence as standard, reserve or third level medication. We report proportions of prescriptions in the first and third priority levels of the {PAS} in primary care, cardiology, and neurology/psychiatry as their prescriptions have a high correspondence with the {PAS}.

{RESULTS}

The proportion in the first priority in primary care was more than two-thirds of the total prescriptions. The highest proportion in this category was observed in Bremen; the lowest proportions were found in the new federal states. In cardiology, the first priority was chosen in 54\%, in neurology/psychiatry in about 41\% of prescriptions ({DDDs}). The proportion of the third priority is with one-fifth highest in cardiology, with 16\%, lowest in primary care; neurology/psychiatry takes a middle position with 17.7\%.

{CONCLUSIONS}

Prescriptions predominantly conformed with the first priority of the {PAS}. There were variations across disciplines and regions (federal states). The {PAS} offers an opportunity to connect quality and indication in the prescription process.

{HINTERGRUND}

Die medizinische Versorgung hat sich an der Evidenz aus validen und relevanten Studien zu orientieren; dieses Prinzip ist in Deutschland sozialrechtlich normiert. Der Medikationskatalog der Kassenärztlichen Bundesvereinigung bietet für mehrere Verordnungsgebiete eine systematische Klassifizierung von Medikamenten nach der zugrundeliegenden Studienevidenz, der Sicherheit und des indikationsgerechten Einsatzes der entsprechenden Substanz.

{METHODIK}

Die Auswertungen beruhen auf den Arzneiverordnungsdaten nach 300 {SGB} V des Jahres 2014. Die jeweiligen Substanzen sind als Standard (1. Priorität), Reserve (2. Priorität) oder nachrangig zu verordnen (3. Priorität) eingestuft. Es werden die Anteile an den Verordnungen der 1. und 3. Prioritäten des Medikationskataloges bei den Fachgruppen der Hausärzte, der Kardiologen und der Neurologen/Psychiater/Nervenärzte berichtet, da deren Verordnungen eine hohe Abdeckung durch den Medikationskatalog aufweisen.

{ERGEBNISSE}

Insgesamt liegt der Anteil bei den Hausärzten in der 1. Priorität bei etwas mehr als zwei Dritteln. Den höchsten Anteil der Kategorie 1 hat Bremen; die niedrigsten Anteile finden sich in den neuen Bundesländern. In der kardiologischen Versorgung macht die Priorität 1 ca. 54\%, in der neurologisch-psychiatrischen Versorgung ca. 41\% der Verordnungen ({DDDs}) aus. Der Anteil der Priorität 3 ist in der Kardiologie mit einem Fünftel der Verordnungen am höchsten, bei den Hausärzten mit 16\% am niedrigsten; die neurologisch-psychiatrische Versorgung nimmt mit 17.7\% eine mittlere Position ein.

{SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN}

Überwiegend entsprechen die analysierten Verordnungen der Priorität 1 des Medikationskatalogs. Dabei ergeben sich jedoch Variationen nach Fachgebieten und Regionen (Ländern). Der Medikationskatalog bietet die Chance, die Perspektiven von Qualität und indikationsgerechtem Einsatz zu verbinden.},

In a recent study of our research group using confirmatory factor analysis, we modeled positive and negative emotion as well as emotion regulation skills along with the classical {ADHD}-core symptoms. We showed that negative affect and the failure to apply adaptive emotion regulation skills were distinct and indicative dimensions in adult {ADHD}. In this study, we used a person-centered approach based on cluster analysis to subtype patients on the presence or relative absence of {ERD}. This results in important information to individualize treatment decisions. We found two clusters, with cluster 2 showing high {ERD} that were associated with higher impairments indicated by depressive mood, negative affect and elevated psychological distress. There were also higher rates of comorbidity in cluster 2 such as somatoform disorders which were associated with {ERD}. Women were overrepresented in this cluster 2. Neuropsychological variables did not contribute significantly to cluster formation. In conclusion, {ADHD} in adults is a heterogeneous disorder with specific subgroups that need differential treatment approaches.},

Our aim in this exploratory study was to search for relevant {GP} subgroups and their characteristics in order to find starting points for improvements or interventions. We attempted a comprehensive survey of all {GPs} in the German region of Siegen-Wittgenstein with about 280,000 inhabitants. There were 158 {GPs} in the total population; 85 of these (53.8\%) took part in the study. There were 64 male {GPs} (75.3\%) in our sample. The mean age of the participants was 53.5 years ({SD} 8.93). The questionnaire was composed of demographic questions, questions regarding future perspectives, the Motivation for Medical Education Questionnaire ({MoME}-Q), the Maslach Burnout Inventory ({MBI}), and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire. K-means cluster analyses were used for subgrouping. A 2-cluster solution had good statistical quality criteria. Cluster 1 was characterised by elderly {GPs} who more frequently had a resident physician in their practices. These {GPs} had low burnout scores and high work satisfaction scores. Cluster 2 consisted of younger {GPs} who less frequently had a resident in their practices. They had average burnout scores according to published norms and lower work satisfaction scores. There seems to be an age cohort effect regarding burnout and work satisfaction. Having a resident physician seems to be protective. Interventions should be designed for younger {GPs}, especially members of generation Y, to reduce burnout and improve work satisfaction.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}

Emotional symptoms are common and persistent in youth and adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) and cause clinically significant impairments. We review recent neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and peripheral psychophysiological evidence for emotion and emotion regulation deficits in {ADHD} across youth and adults.

{RECENT} {FINDINGS}

Central and autonomous nervous system correlates argue in favor of more general self-regulation deficits and also specific emotional deficits in {ADHD}. These include general performance deficits in executive functions, and structural as well as functional impairments in neuronal networks associated with top-down self-regulation. Specific deficits with bottom-up emotional activation in the amygdala and emotion evaluation associated with the orbitofrontal cortex have also been described. Furthermore, vagally mediated, high-frequency heart rate variability is associated with emotional self-regulation deficits throughout the life span. The current evidence is based on multilevel studies that assess associations of emotion regulation. However, further studies that adequately consider the processual recursive character of emotion generation and regulation may give important new insights into emotional regulation of {ADHD}. Emotion regulation deficits in {ADHD} are associated with specific as well as general self-regulation deficits traceable on the level of neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and psychophysiological assessments. The temporal dynamics of the interplay of those different systems need further study in order to optimize and personalize treatment of emotion regulation difficulties, including emotional reactivity, in patients with {ADHD}.},

	volume = {7},
	issn = {2167-8359},
	doi = {10.7717/peerj.6235},
	abstract = {Background

The establishment of a medical education program in the rural area of Siegen is planned to be the first step against a shortage of physicians in this region. General practitioners ({GPs}) will be extensively involved in this program as Family Medicine (Allgemeinmedizin) will become a core subject in the curriculum nationwide. Based on this situation we aim to figure out {GPs} motivation to participate in medical education. For this purpose, we had to construct and test a new questionnaire.

Methods

A survey was conducted among general practitioners ({GPs}) in the region of Siegen-Wittgenstein regarding their motivation to participate in medical education. For this purpose, the Motivation for Medical Education Questionnaire ({MoME}-Q), a 24-item questionnaire, was developed. Structural characteristics of {GPs}, the Maslach Burnout Inventory ({MBI}) and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire ({WSQ}) were used for validation purposes.

Results

A representative number of {GPs} took part in the study (53.8\%). Although the majority had no connection to a university (86\%), 83\% can imagine participating in the education of medical students. The items of the {MoME}-Q load on two factors (commitment and personal benefit). The confirmatory factor analysis shows a good model fit. Subscales of the {MoME}-Q were able to differentiate between physicians with and without authorization to train {GP} residents, between practices with and without a specialized practice nurse, and between physicians with and without previous experience in medical education. The {MoME}-Q subscale commitment correlated significantly with all three subscales of the {MBI}. Correlations were in the medium range around {\textbar}.30{\textbar}.

Conclusion

The {MoME}-Q seems to be an appropriate tool to assess motivation to participate in medical education of {GPs}. In our sample, a large number of {GPs} was motivated to participate in the education of medical students. Future studies with larger number of {GPs} should be carried out to validate and confirm our findings. Whether the {MoME}-Q is also appropriate for other specialties should also be shown in further empirical studies.},

	title = {Burnout and work satisfaction in general practitioners practicing in rural areas: results from the {HaMEdSi} study},
	volume = {11},
	issn = {1179-1578},
	doi = {10.2147/PRBM.S179503},
	abstract = {Background

An increasing number of general practitioners ({GPs}) are not satisfied with their working conditions and are at risk of developing burnout symptoms. As family medicine is becoming a major subject within the medical curriculum in Germany, practicing {GPs} need to meet higher demands in the future, ie, treating patients and taking part in the education of medical students. Accordingly, we aimed to determine {GPs}' work satisfaction and risk of burnout.

Materials and methods

A survey was conducted among {GPs} in the region of Siegen-Wittgenstein. This area is a representative rural region in Germany. The Maslach Burnout Inventory ({MBI}) was used to assess the risk of burnout, while the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire ({WSQ}) was applied to assess work satisfaction. Canonical correlations were used to examine the association between work satisfaction and burnout in {GPs}.

Results

A good model fit was demonstrated for both the {MBI} and the {WSQ}. The canonical correlation analysis resulted in two statistically significant canonical functions with correlations of 0.64 (P0.001) and 0.56 (P=0.001). The full model across all functions was significant (q2 [18]=72.41, P0.001). Burden and the global item in the {WSQ} are good predictors of emotional exhaustion, while patient care, personal rewards and professional relations seem to be good predictors of depersonalization/lack of empathy. This supports the approach to burnout as a multidimensional construct which has to be thoroughly diagnosed.

Conclusion

Differential interventions tailored to {GPs} with specific deficits in certain areas should be delivered. {GPs} with a high score on emotional exhaustion would need a different intervention, as these respondents have different associations with work satisfaction than do {GPs} with a high score for depersonalization/low empathy. Therefore, the results of this study could contribute to the design of differential interventions aimed at ameliorating symptoms of burnout in {GPs}.},

	title = {Von der Elite des Sports zum Arbeitssüchtigen? – Ein Vergleich zwischen ehemaligen Kaderathleten und Nicht-Sportlern},
	url = {https://www.asp2019.de/},
	abstract = {Leistungssportlern werden oft Eigenschaften zugeschrieben, die auch für das Berufsleben vorteilhaft sind. Sie seien besonders leistungsmotiviert, frustrationstolerant und ehrgeizig. Diese Eigenschaften führen dazu, dass sie sich in Aufgaben „festbeißen“ können und diese auch gegen Widerstände ausdauernd bearbeiten. Im Extremfall kann ein solches Verhalten suchtartige Ausmaße annehmen – es wird dann von Arbeitssucht gesprochen. Arbeitssucht kann zu psychischer und physischer Erschöpfung sowie zu gesundheitlichen Beschwerden führen. Lennighaus (2017) zeigte, dass aktive Spitzenfußballer eine höhere Tendenz zur Arbeitssucht besitzen als Topmanager.
Wir untersuchten, ob ehemalige Eliteathleten auch nach ihrer Spitzensportkarriere anfällig für arbeitssüchtiges Verhalten sind. Dazu wurden in einer Online-Studie 30 ehemalige A-, B- und C-Kaderathleten olympischer Individualsportarten (16 Männer, 14 Frauen, Altersdurchschnitt = 31,4) mittels der Skala zur Erfassung von Arbeitssucht (Schneider \& Bühler, 2014) befragt. Ergänzend wurden gesundheitliche Beschwerden und Stressbewältigungsstrategien erfasst. Als Vergleichsgruppe dienten 34 Personen ohne leistungssportlichen Hintergrund (23 Männer, 9 Frauen, 2 o.A., Altersdurchschnitt = 33,0)
Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchung zeigen, dass ehemalige Eliteathleten gegenüber Nicht-Eliteathleten hinsichtlich des Auftretens von Arbeitssucht keine signifikanten Unterschiede aufweisen (t(47.94)=-.88, p=.19, 1-seitig). Die Mittelwerte für die Arbeitssucht liegen bei beiden Gruppen im mittleren Normbereich. Auch für die gesundheitlichen Beschwerden (t(62)=1.01, p=.32, 2-seitig) und die Stressbewältigungsstrategien (Aktives Coping t(62)=-.20, p=.84; Soziale Unterstützung t(62)=1.26, p=.21; Alkohol- und Zigarettenkonsum t(62)=-.82, p=.41, alle 2-seitig) wurden keine Unterschiede zwischen den Gruppen festgestellt.
Eine Sportkader-Biographie erhöht daher nicht die Wahrscheinlichkeit für eine Arbeitssucht nach Beendigung der sportlichen Karriere.},

Reading speeds were higher for upper- than for mixed-case text at sizes twice acuity size; at larger sizes, the upper-case advantage disappeared.

This study aims to investigate the extent to which {ResearchGate} members as authors of journal articles comply with publishers’ copyright policies when they self-archive full-text of their articles on {ResearchGate}. A random sample of 500 English journal articles available as full-text on {ResearchGate} were investigated. 108 articles (21.6\%) were open access ({OA}) published in {OA} journals or hybrid journals. Of the remaining 392 articles, 61 (15.6\%) were preprint, 24 (6.1\%) were post-print and 307 (78.3\%) were published (publisher) {PDF}. The key finding was that 201 (51.3\%) out of 392 non-{OA} articles infringed the copyright and were non-compliant with publishers’ policy. While 88.3\% of journals allowed some form of self-archiving ({SHERPA}/{RoMEO} green, blue or yellow journals), the majority of non-compliant cases (97.5\%) occurred when authors self-archived publishers’ {PDF} files (final published version). This indicates that authors infringe copyright most of the time not because they are not allowed to self-archive, but because they use the wrong version, which might imply their lack of understanding of copyright policies and/or complexity and diversity of policies.},

	volume = {75},
	abstract = {Background and Purpose. The purpose of this study was to do a pilot test of the effectiveness of prolonged stretch (use of a splint) in reducing knee flexion contractures more than a traditional program of passive range of motion ({PROM}) in a group of nursing home residents. Subjects. The subjects were 28 nursing home residents with 10 degrees or more of knee flexion contracture bilaterally. Eighteen subjects completed the study. Methods. Data were collected prior to the initiation of the intervention and at monthly intervals during the 6 months of treatment. Repeated measurements were made of hip, knee, and ankle range of motion ({ROM}); the torque required to maintain passive knee extension; knee pain; several indicators of function; and cognitive impairment. Both legs of each subject received {PROM} and manual stretching twice a week; in addition, one leg was given a prolonged stretch (use of a splint) five times a week. Results. There were no differences in knee {ROM} between the side that received prolonged stretching and the side that received only {PROM} and manual stretching at the beginning of the study. No differences in {ROM} or torque measurements existed between the side that received prolonged stretching and the side that received only {PROM} and manual stretching at any interval, nor in {ROM} or torque over time for either side. Because of the low statistical power of the study, the results should be viewed with caution. Conclusion and Discussion. Physical therapists need to question whether prolonged stretch for nursing home residents with knee flexion contractures greater than 10 degrees is of any greater benefit than {PROM} and manual stretching. Investigations of other treatment protocols and treatment doses are needed, including work in the area of prevention of knee flexion contractures. For the pilot group of nursing home residents studied, gains in knee extension did not occur with the use of prolonged stretch for 3 hours a day, 5 days per week.},

The Judgement Axis, in its present format, consists of an alphabetical listing of terms that are meant to reflect the clinical opinion of a nurse relating to the state of a nursing phenomenon appearing in Axis A of the {ICNP} beta. A review of literature indicates that judgement can be more extensive. Not considered in the development of the Axis is the fact that judgement can be clinical and actuarial. Actuarial judgement is predictive and based on statistics. Clinical judgement is patient-centred, creative and intuitive. Both are essential in defining nursing judgement. The list presents 49 modifiers in nominal form. Each of these is subordinated, in alphanumeric descending order, by qualifiers that do not conform to the concept of lexical hierarchy. We propose that the 49 terms which appear in the present listing as unique ordinates should be clustered into major categories with synonyms listed as subordinates of the major cluster headings. The qualifiers of degree, which are presently identified as subordinates in Axis B, might be presented in matrix format, providing a scale of degree of the modifier for the nurse.},

However, there are indications of differences between the original {MAAS} and a version with the positively rephrased {MAAS} items (“mirror items”). The present study examines whether the mindfulness facet “mindful attention and awareness” ({MAA}) can be measured with both positively and negatively worded items if we take method effects due to item wording into account. To this end, the 15 negatively worded items of the {MAAS} and additionally 13 positively rephrased items were assessed ( N = 602). Confirmatory factor analyses ({CFA}) models with and without regard to method effects were carried out and evaluated by means of model fit. As a result, the positively and negatively worded items should be seen as different methods that influence the construct validity of mindfulness. Furthermore, a modified version of the {MAAS} ({MAAS}-Short) with five negatively worded items (taken from the {MAAS}) and five positively worded items (“mirror items”) was introduced as an alternative to assess {MAA}. The {MAAS}-Short appears superior to the original {MAAS}. The results and the limitations of the present study are discussed.},

However, studies using a semi-structured interview to determine the prevalence of depression in {ORL} are lacking. Therefore the present study sought to determine the depression prevalence in {ORL} applying a semi-structured diagnostic interview and to further characterize the pathopsychological and demographic characteristics of depression in these patients. {METHODS}: One-hundred inpatients of the otorhinolaryngologic department of a German university hospital participated voluntarily (age M = 38.8 years, {SD} = 13.9; 38.0\% female). Depression was assessed using a clinical interview in which the International Diagnostic Checklist for depression ({IDCL}) was applied. Patients completed the Brief Symptom Inventory ({BSI}) which constitutes three composite scores and nine symptom scales and the Beck Depression Inventory ({BDI}). Multivariate analyses of variance, correlations and effect sizes were conducted. {RESULTS}: A prevalence of depression of 21.0\% was determined, 38.0\% of the depressed patients were female. Depressed patients showed higher scores on the {BSI}-scales "interpersonal sensitivity", "depression", "anxiety", "phobic anxiety" and "psychoticism" with medium effect sizes. {CONCLUSIONS}: High prevalence of depression was found which is in accordance with results of prior studies. Depressed patients showed higher psychological distress as compared to non-depressed patients. The results call for carrying on in engaging in depression research and routine depression screening in {ORL}.},

Emerging evidence across multiple fields suggests that mindfulness is fundamentally connected to many aspects of workplace functioning, but this knowledge base has not been systematically integrated to date. This review coalesces the burgeoning body of mindfulness scholarship into a framework to guide mainstream management research investigating a broad range of constructs. The framework identifies how mindfulness influences attention, with downstream effects on functional domains of cognition, emotion, behavior, and physiology. Ultimately, these domains impact key workplace outcomes, including performance, relationships, and well-being. Consideration of the evidence on mindfulness at work stimulates important questions and challenges key assumptions within management science, generating an agenda for future research.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The investigation of treatment mechanisms in randomized controlled trials has considerable clinical and theoretical relevance. Despite the empirical support for the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ({MBCT}) in the treatment of recurrent major depressive disorder ({MDD}), the specific mechanisms by which {MBCT} leads to therapeutic change remain unclear. {OBJECTIVE}: By means of a systematic review we evaluate how the field is progressing in its empirical investigation of mechanisms of change in {MBCT} for recurrent {MDD}. {METHOD}: To identify relevant studies, a systematic search was conducted. Studies were coded and ranked for quality. {RESULTS}: The search produced 476 articles, of which 23 were included. In line with the theoretical premise, 12 studies found that alterations in mindfulness, rumination, worry, compassion, or meta-awareness were associated with, predicted or mediated {MBCT}'s effect on treatment outcome. In addition, preliminary studies indicated that alterations in attention, memory specificity, self-discrepancy, emotional reactivity and momentary positive and negative affect might play a role in how {MBCT} exerts its clinical effects. {CONCLUSION}: The results suggest that {MBCT} could work through some of the {MBCT} model's theoretically predicted mechanisms. However, there is a need for more rigorous designs that can assess greater levels of causal specificity.},

	abstract = {{AIM}: To assess the relationship of the carriage of {IL}-10-1080 G/A and {IL}-28 rs8099917 C/T polymorphisms to the course of lupus nephritis ({LN}). {SUBJECTS} {AND} {METHODS}: Ninety-nine patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ({SLE}), including 68 with {LN}, were examined. Gene polymorphisms were analyzed using standard molecular genetic techniques. The frequency of the clinical manifestations of {LN} was analyzed; renal survival ({RS}) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. {RESULTS}: Ten-year {RS} rates were 80 and 86\% of the patients with and without the mutant {IL}-10 allele, respectively (p = 0.78). The 10-year {RS} was lower (75\%) in carriers of the mutant {IL}-28 rsl2979860 allele than in patients without this mutant allele (83\%; p = 0.049) and in those of the mutant {IL}28 rs8099917 allele than in patients without the above mutant allele (67 and 88\%, respectively; p = 0.047). {LN} patients, carriers of the mutant {IL}-10-1028 G/A allele, were observed to have higher-grade proteinuria in the presence of nephritic syndrome (mean 6.1 g/l) than those without the mutant allele of this gene (mean 2.9 g/l; p = 0.034). However, the mutant allele carriers responded to treatment better (p = 0.050). The mutant {IL}-10 and {IL}-28 alleles were unassociated with the development of rapidly progressive nephritis, the activity of a renal lupus process, and the rate of onset of {SLE} and {LN}. {CONCLUSION}: In the {LN} patients, the carriage of the mutant {IL}-10 allele A is associated with a better response to treatment and that of the mutant {IL}-28 allele is linked to the severe course of the disease.},

	abstract = {The number of acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions for chronic pain, such as acceptance and commitment therapy ({ACT}), mindfulness-based stress reduction ({MBSR}), and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ({MBCT}), increased in recent years. Therefore an update is warranted of our former systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported effects on the mental and physical health of chronic pain patients. Pubmed, {EMBASE}, {PsycInfo} and Cochrane were searched for eligible studies. Current meta-analysis only included randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}). Studies were rated for quality. Mean quality did not improve in recent years. Pooled standardized mean differences using the random-effect model were calculated to represent the average intervention effect and, to perform subgroup analyses. Outcome measures were pain intensity, depression, anxiety, pain interference, disability and quality of life. Included were twenty-five {RCTs} totaling 1285 patients with chronic pain, in which we compared acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions to the waitlist, (medical) treatment-as-usual, and education or support control groups. Effect sizes ranged from small (on all outcome measures except anxiety and pain interference) to moderate (on anxiety and pain interference) at post-treatment and from small (on pain intensity and disability) to large (on pain interference) at follow-up. {ACT} showed significantly higher effects on depression and anxiety than {MBSR} and {MBCT}. Studies' quality, attrition rate, type of pain and control group, did not moderate the effects of acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions. Current acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions, while not superior to traditional cognitive behavioral treatments, can be good alternatives.},

	abstract = {Mindfulness-based interventions ({MBIs}) are increasingly being delivered through the Internet. Whereas numerous meta-analyses have investigated the effectiveness of face-to-face {MBIs} in the context of mental health and well-being, thus far a quantitative synthesis of the effectiveness of online {MBIs} is lacking. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the overall effects of online {MBIs} on mental health. Fifteen randomised controlled trials were included in this study. A random effects model was used to compute pre-post between-group effect sizes, and the study quality of each of the included trials was rated. Results showed that online {MBIs} have a small but significant beneficial impact on depression (g=0.29), anxiety (g=0.22), well-being (g=0.23) and mindfulness (g=0.32). The largest effect was found for stress, with a moderate effect size (g=0.51). For stress and mindfulness, exploratory subgroup analyses demonstrated significantly higher effect sizes for guided online {MBIs} than for unguided online {MBIs}. In addition, meta-regression analysis showed that effect sizes for stress were significantly moderated by the number of intervention sessions. Effect sizes, however, were not significantly related to study quality. The findings indicate that online {MBIs} have potential to contribute to improving mental health outcomes, particularly stress. Limitations, directions for future research and practical implications are discussed.},

The field responded with suggestions of how fraud could be prevented. However, the Stapel fraud is only one among many cases. Before basing recommendations on one case, it would be informative to study other cases to assess how these frauds were discovered. The authors analyze a convenience sample of fraud cases to see whether (social) psychology is more susceptible to fraud than other disciplines. They also evaluate whether the peer review process and replications work well in practice to detect fraud. There is no evidence that psychology is more vulnerable to fraud than the biomedical sciences, and most frauds are detected through information from whistleblowers with inside information. On the basis of this analysis, the authors suggest a number of strategies that might reduce the risk of scientific fraud.},

	abstract = {{AIM}: The diagnostic performance of Fibroscan might be improved when combined with other serum fibrosis related markers. Previous study has demonstrated that S100A4 expression is associated with liver fibrosis in humans with hepatitis. This study aimed to clarify diagnostic accuracy of serum S100A4 levels for significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B ({CHB}), and develop a combined algorithm of liver stiffness measurement ({LSM}) and S100A4 to predict significant liver fibrosis in {CHB}. {METHODS}: One hundred and seventy-five {CHB} patients who had performed liver biopsy were consecutively included. We evaluated serum S100A4 levels, {LSM} values and other clinically-approved fibrosis scores. {RESULTS}: Serum S100A4 level was higher in {CHB} patients with significant fibrosis, compared to those without [199.58 (33.31-1971.96) vs. 107.15 (2.10-1038.94), P{\textless}0.001]. Using receiver-operating characteristic ({ROC}) analyses, the area under the curves ({AUC}), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of S100A4 were found to be 0.749, 62.7\%, 75.9\% and 0.70 for significant fibrosis (≥Stage 2), respectively. Although not superior to {LSM}, these results were better than the fibrosis index based on the 4 factor ({FIB}-4) and the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index ({APRI}) for significant fibrosis detection. An algorithm consisting of S100A4 and {LSM} was derived. The {AUC}, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of model based on serum S100A4 level and {LSM} were 0.866, 86.6\%, 77.8\% and 0.79 for significant fibrosis detection, superior to those based on {LSM} alone (0.834, 76.1\%, 80.7\% and 0.76, P=0.041). {CONCLUSION}: Serum S100A4 level was identified as a fibrosis marker of liver fibrosis in patients with {CHB}. Combining serum S100A4 with {LSM} improved the accuracy of transient elastography for hepatitis B significant fibrosis detection.},

Study 2 (N = 4,070) compared less extreme groups---namely, online-daters with somewhat unattractive versus somewhat attractive first names. Study 3 (N = 6,775) compared online-daters with currently popular versus currently less popular first names, while controlling for name-popularity at birth. Across all studies, negatively named individuals were more neglected by other online-daters, as indicated by fewer first visits to their dating profiles. This form of neglect arguably mirrors a name-based life history of neglect, discrimination, prejudice, or even ostracism. Supporting this argument, neglect mediated the relation between negative names and lower self-esteem, more frequent smoking, and less education. These results are consistent with the name-based interpersonal neglect hypothesis: Negative names evoke negative interpersonal reactions, which in turn influence people's life outcomes for the worse.},

	abstract = {The p-value has long been the figurehead of statistical analysis in biology, but its position is under threat. p is now widely recognized as providing quite limited information about our data, and as being easily misinterpreted. Many biologists are aware of p's frailties, but less clear about how they might change the way they analyse their data in response. This article highlights and summarizes four broad statistical approaches that augment or replace the p-value, and that are relatively straightforward to apply. First, you can augment your p-value with information about how confident you are in it, how likely it is that you will get a similar p-value in a replicate study, or the probability that a statistically significant finding is in fact a false positive. Second, you can enhance the information provided by frequentist statistics with a focus on effect sizes and a quantified confidence that those effect sizes are accurate. Third, you can augment or substitute p-values with the Bayes factor to inform on the relative levels of evidence for the null and alternative hypotheses; this approach is particularly appropriate for studies where you wish to keep collecting data until clear evidence for or against your hypothesis has accrued. Finally, specifically where you are using multiple variables to predict an outcome through model building, Akaike information criteria can take the place of the p-value, providing quantified information on what model is best. Hopefully, this quick-and-easy guide to some simple yet powerful statistical options will support biologists in adopting new approaches where they feel that the p-value alone is not doing their data justice.},

	abstract = {Health Psychologists using questionnaires rely heavily on Cronbach’s alpha as indicator of scale reliability and internal consistency. Cronbach’s alpha is often viewed as some kind of quality label: high values certify scale quality, low values prompt removal of one or several items. Unfortunately, this approach suffers two fundamental problems. First, Cronbach’s alpha is both unrelated to a scale's internal consistency and a fatally flawed estimate of its reliability. Second, the approach itself assumes that scale items are repeated measurements, an assumption that is often violated and rarely desirable. The problems with Cronbach’s alpha are easily solved by computing readily available alternatives, such as the Greatest Lower Bound or Omega. Solving the second problem, however, is less straightforward. This requires forgoing the appealing comfort of a quantitative, seemingly objective indicator of scale quality altogether, instead acknowledging the dynamics of reliability and validity and the distinction between scales and indices. In this contribution, I will explore these issues, and provide recommendations for scale inspection that takes these dynamics and this distinction into account.},

In fact, Ss reported higher assertiveness after recalling 12 unassertive rather than 12 assertive behaviors. Thus, self-assessments only reflected the implications of recalled content if recall was easy.

There are two major research questions in this study. First, this study tries to find out whether listening to music affect the learner's concentration when they are doing a task such as reading. The second research question is whether light classical music is more distracting or less distracting than hip hop music during a reading comprehension task. An experiment involving 133 participants from a medium-size college in southern Taiwan was conducted where the participants performed a reading comprehension task with either light classical music, hip hop music, or with no music in the background. The result of the study showed that music with a higher intensity is more distracting and has a greater effect on task performance and concentration. The result helped formulate the Attention Drainage Effect theory, which is based on Kahneman's (1973) capacity model of attention. (Contains 2 tables.)},

There is no evidence, however, that attributes such as intelligence, depression, personality traits, etc. are truly quantitative, thus rendering most statistical techniques inappropriate for psychological data. Observation Oriented Modeling ({OOM}) is an alternative data analysis technique that does not require the assumption of continuous quantity, and it is an approach that eschews aggregate statistics while returning individual observations to the forefront of the analysis. Two published mediation models are re-analyzed in the current paper using {OOM} and the results compared to those obtained from traditional, variable-based analyses. It is shown that {OOM} yields results that are entirely transparent and readily interpretable. Unlike traditional analyses, the results also provide a clear understanding of what is happening at the level of the persons in the two studies. {OOM} is therefore a novel way of conceptualizing and analyzing data that may lead to more accurate and complete explanations of psychological phenomena.},

The decision theory proposed here calculates the expected utility of an effect on the basis of (1) the probability of replicating it and (2) a utility function on its size. It takes significance tests--which place all value on the replicability of an effect and none on its magnitude--as a special case, one in which the cost of a false positive is revealed to be an order of magnitude greater than the value of a true positive. More realistic utility functions credit both replicability and effect size, integrating them for a single index of merit. The analysis incorporates opportunity cost and is consistent with alternate measures of effect size, such as r2 and information transmission, and with Bayesian model selection criteria. An alternate formulation is functionally equivalent to the formal theory, transparent, and easy to compute.},

{METHODS}: We detail the pathways involved in the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system and provide pharmacological and neuroimaging data in support of the neural structures linking the central nervous system to {HRV} in humans. We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in {HRV} are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting {HRV} levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between {HRV} and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy.
{CONCLUSION}: These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, {HRV}, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health. Future studies are needed to determine exactly which executive functions are associated with individual differences in {HRV} in a wider range of situations and populations.},

Psychologists think that theorising in the area of psychological testing involves conjuring constructs, which are operationally defined and measured via psychometric tests. However, the ‘construct’ concept is unworkable and laden with confused philosophical baggage accrued under the hegemony of logical empiricism, and its real function in psychology is obscured. Via an analysis of its history and logic, I expose its flawed conception of the relation between theoretical and observable concepts and the way in which it serves the myth of mental measurement. Finally, it is shown how the actual logic of theorising in science, which entails that theories are best inferred from relevant phenomena, not imaginatively constructed, oppugns this myth and promises to coordinate theoretical concepts with the phenomena to be explained.

Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

(Ripley (1996)) Neurons are now known to be more complicated than this model having a graded, rather than threshold, response, operating in continuous time, and achieving nonlinear functions of inputs. (Ripley (1996)) Compared to computers, however, neurons are rather slow, with a speed of about 100 meters/second. (Ripley (1996)) To compensate for this lack of speed, the human brain is highly distributed and massively parallel. (Ripley (1996)) As parallel processes go the human brain is unsurpassed. The pattern of connections between neurons proves to be an ideal model for the neural network’s architecture (Fausett (1994)) Neural networks are essentially comprising three pieces: the architecture or model; the learning algorithm; and the activation functions. (Fausett (1994)) Neural networks are programed or “trained ” to “... store, recognize, and associatively retrieve patterns or database entries; to solve combinatorial optimization problems; to filter noise from measurement data; to control ill-defined problems; in summary, to estimate sampled functions when we do not know the form of the functions. ” (Kosko (1992), p.13) It is precisely these two abilities (pattern recognition and function},

Accurate prediction of genomic breeding values ({GEBVs}) presents a central challenge to contemporary plant and animal breeders. The existence of a wide array of marker-based approaches for predicting breeding values makes it essential to evaluate and compare their relative predictive performances to identify approaches able to accurately predict breeding values. We evaluated the predictive accuracy of random forests ({RF}), stochastic gradient boosting (boosting) and support vector machines ({SVMs}) for predicting genomic breeding values using dense {SNP} markers and explored the utility of {RF} for ranking the predictive importance of markers for pre-screening markers or discovering chromosomal locations of {QTLs}.
{METHODS}: We predicted {GEBVs} for one quantitative trait in a dataset simulated for the {QTLMAS} 2010 workshop. Predictive accuracy was measured as the Pearson correlation between {GEBVs} and observed values using 5-fold cross-validation and between predicted and true breeding values. The importance of each marker was ranked using {RF} and plotted against the position of the marker and associated {QTLs} on one of five simulated chromosomes.
{RESULTS}: The correlations between the predicted and true breeding values were 0.547 for boosting, 0.497 for {SVMs}, and 0.483 for {RF}, indicating better performance for boosting than for {SVMs} and {RF}.

Dementia and cognitive impairment associated with aging are a major medical and social concern. Neuropsychological testing is a key element in the diagnostic procedures of Mild Cognitive Impairment ({MCI}), but has presently a limited value in the prediction of progression to dementia. We advance the hypothesis that newer statistical classification methods derived from data mining and machine learning methods like Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests can improve accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of predictions obtained from neuropsychological testing. Seven non parametric classifiers derived from data mining methods (Multilayer Perceptrons Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, {CART}, {CHAID} and {QUEST} Classification Trees and Random Forests) were compared to three traditional classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression) in terms of overall classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, Area under the {ROC} curve and Press'Q. Model predictors were 10 neuropsychological tests currently used in the diagnosis of dementia. Statistical distributions of classification parameters obtained from a 5-fold cross-validation were compared using the Friedman's nonparametric test.

Results
Press' Q test showed that all classifiers performed better than chance alone (p {\textless} 0.05). Support Vector Machines showed the larger overall classification accuracy (Median (Me) = 0.76) an area under the {ROC} (Me = 0.90). However this method showed high specificity (Me = 1.0) but low sensitivity (Me = 0.3). Random Forest ranked second in overall accuracy (Me = 0.73) with high area under the {ROC} (Me = 0.73) specificity (Me = 0.73) and sensitivity (Me = 0.64). Linear Discriminant Analysis also showed acceptable overall accuracy (Me = 0.66), with acceptable area under the {ROC} (Me = 0.72) specificity (Me = 0.66) and sensitivity (Me = 0.64). The remaining classifiers showed overall classification accuracy above a median value of 0.63, but for most sensitivity was around or even lower than a median value of 0.5.

Conclusions
When taking into account sensitivity, specificity and overall classification accuracy Random Forests and Linear Discriminant analysis rank first among all the classifiers tested in prediction of dementia using several neuropsychological tests. These methods may be used to improve accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of Dementia predictions from neuropsychological testing.},

We argue that data analysis is primarily a procedure to build understanding, and as such, it dovetails with the cognitive processes of the human mind. Data analysis tasks closely resemble the cognitive process known as sensemaking. We demonstrate how data analysis is a sensemaking task adapted to use quantitative data. This identification highlights a universal structure within data analysis activities and provides a foundation for a theory of data analysis. The competing tensions of cognitive compatibility and scientific rigour create a series of problems that characterise the data analysis process. These problems form a useful organising model for the data analysis task while allowing methods to remain flexible and situation dependent. The insights of this model are especially helpful for consultants, applied statisticians and teachers of data analysis.},

	abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.{RATIONALEThere} is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.{RESULTSWe} conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, {SD} = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, {SD} = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P \&lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.{CONCLUSIONNo} single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original.

It combines effect-size estimation with hypothesis testing, assessing the extent to which the replication results are consistent with an effect size big enough to have been detectable in the original study. The approach is demonstrated by examining replications of three well-known findings. Its benefits include the following: (a) differentiating “unsuccessful” replication attempts (i.e., studies yielding p {\textgreater} .05) that are too noisy from those that actively indicate the effect is undetectably different from zero, (b) “protecting” true findings from underpowered replications, and (c) arriving at intuitively compelling inferences in general and for the revisited replications in particular.},

Because p values dominate statistical analysis in psychology, it is important to ask what p says about replication. The answer to this question is “Surprisingly little.” In one simulation of 25 repetitions of a typical experiment, p varied from {\textless}.001 to .76, thus illustrating that p is a very unreliable measure. This article shows that, if an initial experiment results in two-tailed p = .05, there is an 80\% chance the one-tailed p value from a replication will fall in the interval (.00008, .44), a 10\% chance that p {\textless}.00008, and fully a 10\% chance that p {\textgreater}.44. Remarkably, the interval—termed a p interval—is this wide however large the sample size. p is so unreliable and gives such dramatically vague information that it is a poor basis for inference. Confidence intervals, however, give much better information about replication. Researchers should minimize the role of p by using confidence intervals and model-fitting techniques and by adopting meta-analytic thinking.},

This article reviews the history and nature of factor score indeterminacy. Novel computer programs for assessing the degree of indeterminacy in a given analysis, as well as for computing and evaluating different types of factor scores, are then presented and demonstrated using data from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Third Edition. It is argued that factor score indeterminacy should be routinely assessed and reported as part of any exploratory factor analysis and that factor scores should be thoroughly evaluated before they are reported or used in subsequent statistical analyses.

Implementations are provided that range from depending only on the p-value to consideration of full Bayesian analysis.

Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of thep value procedure. In particular,p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover,p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to thesep value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion ({BIC}) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The {BIC} provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from {SPSS} output.},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

To address this omission, this paper introduces the simple difference formula. The formula states that the correlation equals the simple difference between the proportion of favorable and unfavorable evidence; in symbols this is r = f - u. For the Mann-Whitney U, the evidence consists of pairs. For the signed-rank test, the evidence consists of rank sums. Also, the formula applies to the Binomial Effect Size Display. The formula r = f - u means that a correlation r can yield a prediction so that the proportion correct is f and the proportion incorrect is u.},

The resources are presented in an incremental order, starting with theoretical foundations and moving on to applied issues. In addition, we outline an additional 32 articles and books that can be consulted to gain background knowledge about various theoretical specifics and Bayesian approaches to frequently used models. Our goal is to offer researchers a starting point for understanding the core tenets of Bayesian analysis, while requiring a low level of time commitment.

With participants’ consent, these data can be recorded retrospectively in a convenient, accurate, and inexpensive way. Based on our experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining multiple Facebook-based psychological studies that attracted over 10 million participants, we demonstrate how to recruit participants using Facebook, incentivize them effectively, and maximize their engagement.

	abstract = {Language use is a psychologically rich, stable individual difference with well-established correlations to personality. We describe a method for assessing personality using an open-vocabulary analysis of language from social media. We compiled the written language from 66,732 Facebook users and their questionnaire-based self-reported Big Five personality traits, and then we built a predictive model of personality based on their language. We used this model to predict the 5 personality factors in a separate sample of 4,824 Facebook users, examining (a) convergence with self-reports of personality at the domain- and facet-level; (b) discriminant validity between predictions of distinct traits; (c) agreement with informant reports of personality; (d) patterns of correlations with external criteria (e.g., number of friends, political attitudes, impulsiveness); and (e) test-retest reliability over 6-month intervals. Results indicated that language-based assessments can constitute valid personality measures: they agreed with self-reports and informant reports of personality, added incremental validity over informant reports, adequately discriminated between traits, exhibited patterns of correlations with external criteria similar to those found with self-reported personality, and were stable over 6-month intervals. Analysis of predictive language can provide rich portraits of the mental life associated with traits. This approach can complement and extend traditional methods, providing researchers with an additional measure that can quickly and cheaply assess large groups of participants with minimal burden.},

Just weeks ago, a paper about the relationship between tissue-specific cancer incidence and stem cell divisions (2) was widely misreported because of misunderstandings about the primary statistical argument in the paper (3). Public pressure has contributed to the massive recent adoption of reproducible research tools, with corresponding improvements in reproducibility. But an analysis can be fully reproducible and still be wrong. Even the most spectacularly irreproducible analyses—like those underlying the ongoing lawsuits (4) over failed genomic signatures for chemotherapy assignment (5)—are ultimately reproducible (6). Once an analysis is reproducible, the key question we want to answer is, “Is this data analysis correct?” We have found that the most frequent failure in data analysis is mistaking the type of question being considered.

	abstract = {This paper outlines a general framework for ordering information in visual displays (tables and graphs) according to the effects or trends which we desire to see. This idea, termed effect-ordered data displays, applies principally to the arrangement of unordered factors for quantitative data and frequency data, and to the arrangement of variables and observations in multivariate displays (star plots, parallel coordinate plots, and so forth).As examples of this principle, we present several techniques for ordering items, levels or variables "optimally", based on some desired criterion. All of these may be based on eigenvalue or singular-value decompositions.Along the way, we tell some stories about data display, illustrated by graphs--some surprisingly bad, and some surprisingly good--for showing patterns, trends, and anomalies in data. We hope to raise more questions than we can provide answers for.},

Research question should precede the other questions; methods should be chosen according to the research question and not vice versa. Modern quantitative psychology has accepted method as primary; research questions are adjusted to the methods. For understanding thinking in modern quantitative psychology, two epistemologies should be distinguished: structural-systemic that is based on Aristotelian thinking, and associative-quantitative that is based on Cartesian-Humean thinking. The first aims at understanding the structure that underlies the studied processes; the second looks for identification of cause-effect relationships between the events with no possible access to the understanding of the structures that underlie the processes. Quantitative methodology in particular as well as mathematical psychology in general, is useless for answering questions about structures and processes that underlie observed behaviors. Nevertheless, quantitative science is almost inevitable in a situation where the systemic-structural basis of behavior is not well understood; all sorts of applied decisions can be made on the basis of quantitative studies. In order to proceed, psychology should study structures; methodologically, constructive experiments should be added to observations and analytic experiments.},

	abstract = {The scientific community has witnessed growing concern about the high rate of false positives and unreliable results within the psychological literature, but the harmful impact of false negatives has been largely ignored. False negatives are particularly concerning in research areas where demonstrating the absence of an effect is crucial, such as studies of unconscious or implicit processing. Research on implicit processes seeks evidence of above-chance performance on some implicit behavioral measure at the same time as chance-level performance (that is, a null result) on an explicit measure of awareness. A systematic review of 73 studies of contextual cuing, a popular implicit learning paradigm, involving 181 statistical analyses of awareness tests, reveals how underpowered studies can lead to failure to reject a false null hypothesis. Among the studies that reported sufficient information, the meta-analytic effect size across awareness tests was d z = 0.31 (95 \% {CI} 0.24-0.37), showing that participants' learning in these experiments was conscious. The unusually large number of positive results in this literature cannot be explained by selective publication. Instead, our analyses demonstrate that these tests are typically insensitive and underpowered to detect medium to small, but true, effects in awareness tests. These findings challenge a widespread and theoretically important claim about the extent of unconscious human cognition.},

It suggests that the original reasons why the standard deviation concept has permeated traditional statistics are no longer clearly valid, if they ever were. The absolute mean deviation, it is argued here, has many advantages over the standard deviation. It is more efficient as an estimate of a population parameter in the real-life situation where the data contain tiny errors, or do not form a completely perfect normal distribution. It is easier to use, and more tolerant of extreme values, in the majority of real-life situations where population parameters are not required. It is easier for new researchers to learn about and understand, and also closely linked to a number of arithmetic techniques already used in the sociology of education and elsewhere. We could continue to use the standard deviation instead, as we do presently, because so much of the rest of traditional statistics is based upon it (effect sizes, and the F-test, for example). However, we should weigh the convenience of this solution for some against the possibility of creating a much simpler and more widespread form of numeric analysis for many.},

According to the fallacy, high-power experiments always yield more informative data than do low-power experiments. Here we expose the fallacy with concrete examples, demonstrating that a particular outcome from a high-power experiment can be completely uninformative, whereas a particular outcome from a low-power experiment can be highly informative. Although power is useful in planning an experiment, it is less useful-and sometimes even misleading-for making inferences from observed data. To make inferences from data, we recommend the use of likelihood ratios or Bayes factors, which are the extension of likelihood ratios beyond point hypotheses. These methods of inference do not average over hypothetical replications of an experiment, but instead condition on the data that have actually been observed. In this way, likelihood ratios and Bayes factors rationally quantify the evidence that a particular data set provides for or against the null or any other hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Low birth weight ({LBW}) infants have lower infant mortality in groups in which {LBW} is most frequent. For example, in 1991, {US} infants born to smokers had higher risks of both {LBW} and infant mortality than infants born to nonsmokers. However, among {LBW} infants, infant mortality was lower for infants born to smokers (relative rate = 0.79). There are competing theories regarding this so-called "paradox." One is that maternal smoking is beneficial for {LBW} infants. The authors use causal diagrams to show that, even in the absence of any beneficial effect of smoking, an inverse association due to stratification on birth weight can be found. This variable is affected by the exposure of interest and shares common causes with the outcome. That is, {LBW} infants born to smokers may have a lower risk of mortality than other {LBW} infants whose {LBW} is due to causes associated with high mortality (e.g., birth defects). Under realistic causal diagrams, adjustment for birth weight is unwarranted when the analytical goal is to estimate overall effects of prenatal variables on infant mortality. Even for estimating direct effects of prenatal variables, adjustment for birth weight may be invalid when there is an unmeasured common cause of {LBW} and mortality. An appropriate justification for conditioning on birth weight requires specifying 1) the causal question motivating this analytical approach and 2) the assumptions regarding the proposed underlying biologic mechanisms.},

These dictionaries have generally been applied through word count methods which have proven to be both simple and effective. In this paper, we introduce Distributed Dictionary Representations ({DDR}), a method that applies psychological dictionaries using semantic similarity rather than word counts. This allows for the measurement of the similarity between dictionaries and spans of text ranging from complete documents to individual words. We show how {DDR} enables dictionary authors to place greater emphasis on construct validity without sacrificing linguistic coverage. We further demonstrate the benefits of {DDR} on two real-world tasks and finally conduct an extensive study of the interaction between dictionary size and task performance. These studies allow us to examine how {DDR} and word count methods complement one another as tools for applying concept dictionaries and where each is best applied. Finally, we provide references to tools and resources to make this method both available and accessible to a broad psychological audience.},

	abstract = {Study objective: In social epidemiology, it is easy to compute and interpret measures of variation in multilevel linear regression, but technical difficulties exist in the case of logistic regression. The aim of this study was to present measures of variation appropriate for the logistic case in a didactic rather than a mathematical way. Design and participants: Data were used from the health survey conducted in 2000 in the county of Scania, Sweden, that comprised 10 723 persons aged 18–80 years living in 60 areas. Conducting multilevel logistic regression different techniques were applied to investigate whether the individual propensity to consult private physicians was statistically dependent on the area of residence (that is, intraclass correlation ({ICC}), median odds ratio ({MOR})), the 80\% interval odds ratio ({IOR}-80), and the sorting out index). Results: The {MOR} provided more interpretable information than the {ICC} on the relevance of the residential area for understanding the individual propensity of consulting private physicians. The {MOR} showed that the unexplained heterogeneity between areas was of greater relevance than the individual variables considered in the analysis (age, sex, and education) for understanding the individual propensity of visiting private physicians. Residing in a high education area increased the probability of visiting a private physician. However, the {IOR} showed that the unexplained variability between areas did not allow to clearly distinguishing low from high propensity areas with the area educational level. The sorting out index was equal to 82\%. Conclusion: Measures of variation in logistic regression should be promoted in social epidemiological and public health research as efficient means of quantifying the importance of the context of residence for understanding disparities in health and health related behaviour.},

A total of 1878 health care professionals (nurses, therapists, technicians, pharmacists and physicians) were included in a study. {RESULTS}: The eight dimensions measuring worker attitudes (free communication flow, continuous improvement, reporting/rules compliance and patient/family involvement) and organizational factors (supervisors' safety leadership, allied professionals' safety leadership, patient safety committee leadership and rules/equipment availability) were extracted by factor analysis. The internal consistency (measured by Cronbach's alpha) and repeatability (measured by intraclass correlation) were more than 0.70 for all subscales. In addition, the mean score, the within-group interrater reliability statistic (r(wg)) and the correlation coefficients of the mean score were confirmed at the workplace level. {CONCLUSIONS}: The scale showed acceptable dimensionality, reliability and validity. It also provided workplace team-evaluation and a tool for assessing the patient safety climate at the level of the workplace.},

Die Skala erwies sich als homogen und stabil, korrelierte negativ mit dem Alter, kovariierte mit dem Geschlecht (Männer waren ungewißheitstoleranter) und war unabhängig von der Tendenz zu sozial erwünschtem Antwortverhalten. Personen suchten um so eher Situationen auf, in denen sie Neues erfahren konnten (Gesundheitsvorsorgekurs), oder ertrugen ungewisse Situationen (Ungewißheit über eine mögliche Schwangerschaft) um so länger, je ungewißheitstoleranter sie waren. Mit wachsender Ungewißheitstoleranz war die Neigung zur positiven Umdeutung einer Belastungssituation (bei Eltern von Risikokindern, bei Töchtern, die ihre bettlägerigen Mütter pflegten) ausgeprägter. Auch war die Depressivität akut (Frauen im Schwangerschaftskonflikt) sowie dauerhaft belasteter Frauen (Mütter behinderter Kinder) um so schwächer, je ungewißheitstoleranter sie waren. The properties of the uncertainty tolerance scale are given. The scale consists of 8 items, was homogeneous and stable, correlated negatively with age, covaried with gender (men were more uncertainty tolerant), and was independent of social desirability. Persons participated with a higher probability in a situation in which they could learn something new (here: a health prevention course) or they endured longer in an uncertain situation (uncertainty about a possible pregnancy) the higher their uncertainty tolerance was. With increased uncertainty tolerance the probability of finding a positive meaning in one's burdening situation (having a disabled child, caring for a bed-ridden mother) was higher. Additionally, the psychic well-being of acute (women with a pregnancy conflict) or chronically burdened women (mothers of a disabled child) was higher the higher their uncertainty tolerance was.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have documented the positive effects of mindfulness meditation on executive control. What has been lacking, however, is an understanding of the mechanism underlying this effect. Some theorists have described mindfulness as embodying two facets-present moment awareness and emotional acceptance. Here, we examine how the effect of meditation practice on executive control manifests in the brain, suggesting that emotional acceptance and performance monitoring play important roles. We investigated the effect of meditation practice on executive control and measured the neural correlates of performance monitoring, specifically, the error-related negativity ({ERN}), a neurophysiological response that occurs within 100 ms of error commission. Meditators and controls completed a Stroop task, during which we recorded {ERN} amplitudes with electroencephalography. Meditators showed greater executive control (i.e. fewer errors), a higher {ERN} and more emotional acceptance than controls. Finally, mediation pathway models further revealed that meditation practice relates to greater executive control and that this effect can be accounted for by heightened emotional acceptance, and to a lesser extent, increased brain-based performance monitoring.},

	abstract = {Published January 2006, 223 pages. {SUMMARY}: Dashboards have become popular in recent years as uniquely powerful tools for communicating important information at a glance. Although dashboards are potentially powerful, this potential is rarely realized. The greatest display technology in the world won't solve this if you fail to use effective visual design. And if a dashboard fails to tell you precisely what you need to know in an instant, you'll never use it, even if it's filled with cute gauges, meters, and traffic lights. Don't let your investment in dashboard technology go to waste. This book will teach you the visual design skills you need to create dashboards that communicate clearly, rapidly, and compellingly. "Information Dashboard Design" will explain how to: Avoid the thirteen mistakes common to dashboard design Provide viewers with the information they need quickly and clearly Apply what we now know about visual perception to the visual presentation of information Minimize distractions, cliches, and unnecessary embellishments that create confusion Organize business information to support meaning and usability Create an aesthetically pleasing viewing experience Maintain consistency of design to provide accurate interpretation Optimize the power of dashboard technology by pairing it with visual effectiveness Stephen Few has over 20 years of experience as an {IT} innovator, consultant, and educator.

In the current study, long-term meditators and demographically similar nonmeditators completed self-report measures of constructs expected to be related to the practice of mindfulness meditation. Extent of meditation experience was correlated in the expected directions with levels of mindfulness and with many other variables. Mean differences between meditators and nonmeditators were significant in most cases. Mediation analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that practicing meditation is associated with increased mindfulness in daily life, which is related to decreased rumination, decreased fear of emotion, and increased behavioral self-regulation. These mechanisms appear partially responsible for the relationships between mindfulness skills and psychological adjustment. Overall, the current study suggests that the long-term practice of mindfulness meditation may cultivate mindfulness skills and promote adaptive functioning.},

This shift is away from manual control and toward activities that tap the higher mental functioning of human operators. Therefore, an experiment was performed in a moving-base flight simulator to assess mediational (cognitive) workload measurement. Specifically, 16 workload estimation techniques were evaluated as to their sensitivity and intrusion in a flight task emphasizing mediational behavior. Task loading, using navigation problems presented on a display, was treated as an independent variable, and workload-measure values were treated as dependent variables. Results indicate that two mediational task measures, two rating scale measures, time estimation, and two eye behavior measures were reliably sensitive to mediational loading. The time estimation measure did, however, intrude on mediational task performance. Several of the remaining measures were completely insensitive to mediational load.},

In Experiment 3, suppressing emotion led to a subsequent drop in performance of solvable anagrams. In Experiment 4, an initial task requiring high self-regulation made people more passive (i.e., more prone to favor the passive-response option).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Contractures are a common complication of neurological and musculoskeletal conditions, and are characterised by a reduction in joint mobility. Stretch is widely used for the treatment and prevention of contractures. However, it is not clear whether stretch is effective. {OBJECTIVES}: To determine the effects of stretch on contractures in people with, or at risk of, contractures. {SEARCH} {STRATEGY}: Electronic searches were conducted on {CENTRAL}, {DARE}, {HTA} (The Cochrane Library); {MEDLINE}; {CINAHL}; {EMBASE}; {SCI}-{EXPANDED}; and {PEDro} (April 2009). {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials of stretch applied for the purpose of treating or preventing contractures were included. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes of interest were joint mobility and quality of life. The secondary outcomes were pain, spasticity, activity limitation and participation restriction. Outcomes were evaluated immediately after intervention, in the short term (one to seven days) and in the long term ({\textgreater} one week). Effects were expressed as mean differences or standardised mean differences with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}). Meta-analyses were conducted with a random-effects model. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Thirty-five studies with 1391 participants met the inclusion criteria. No study performed stretch for more than seven months. In people with neurological conditions, there was moderate to high quality evidence to indicate that stretch does not have clinically important immediate (mean difference 3 degrees ; 95\% {CI} 0 to 7), short-term (mean difference 1 degrees ; 95\% {CI} 0 to 3) or long-term (mean difference 0 degrees ; 95\% {CI} -2 to 2) effects on joint mobility. The results were similar for people with non-neurological conditions. For all conditions, there is little or no effect of stretch on pain, spasticity, activity limitation, participation restriction or quality of life. {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Stretch does not have clinically important effects on joint mobility in people with, or at risk of, contractures if performed for less than seven months. The effects of stretch performed for periods longer than seven months have not been investigated.},

Three studies were designed to assess whether the manner in which information is initially presented affects how such information will subsequently be used, that is, in a mindful or mindless way. More specifically, two experiments (one with children, the other with college students) were conducted to compare the effects of a conditional versus absolute form of teaching upon creativity. Results revealed that instruction presented in an absolute manner resulted in mindless use of the information for both age groups. In contrast, subjects who were taught in a conditional way were better able to creatively deal with the information. For the college students, this finding was obtained even when the absolute learning condition was concerned with theoretical (i.e., conditional) information. In a third experiment, student teachers were taught conditionally or unconditionally in a confident or unconfident manner. Results indicated that confident but conditional instruction was most effective in provoking subsequent mindfulness.},

For many years it has been argued the Rasch model is conjoint measurement by several psychometricians. This paper critiques this argument from the perspective of representational measurement theory. It concludes that the Rasch model is not conjoint measurement as the model does not demonstrate the existence of a representation theorem between an empirical relational structure and a numerical relational structure. Psychologists seriously interested in investigating traits for quantitative structure should use the theory of conjoint measurement itself rather than the Rasch model. This is not to say, however, that empirical relationships between conjoint measurement and the Rasch model are precluded. The paper concludes by suggesting some relevant research avenues.},

There are many places in the book where I had to laugh, and that's saying a lot for a book on statistics. His excellent style engages the reader and makes reading about statistics fun' - David C Howell, Professor Emeritus, University of Vermont {USA} This award-winning text, now fully updated with {SPSS} Statistics, is the only book on statistics that you will need! Fully revised and restructured, this new edition is even more accessible as it now takes students through from introductory to advanced level concepts, all the while grounding knowledge through the use of {SPSS} Statistics. Andy Field's humorous and self-deprecating style and the book's host of characters make the journey entertaining as well as educational. While still providing a very comprehensive collection of statistical methods, tests and procedures, and packed with examples and self-assessment tests to reinforce knowledge, the new edition now also offers: - a more gentle introduction to basic-level concepts and methods for beginners - new textbook features to make the book more user-friendly for those learning about more advanced concepts, encouraging 'critical thinking' - a brand new, full-colour design, making it easy for students to navigate between topics, and to understand how to use the latest version of {SPSS} Statistics - both 'real world' (the bizarre and the wonderful) and invented examples illustrate the concepts and make the techniques come alive for students - an additional chapter on multilevel modelling for advanced-level students - reinforced binding to make the book easier to handle at a computer workstation. The book also includes access to a brand new and improved companion Website, bursting with features including: - animated '{SPSS} walk-through' videos clearly demonstrating how to use the latest {SPSS} Statistics modules - self-marking multiple choice questions - data sets for psychology, business and management and health sciences - a flash-card glossary for testing knowledge of key concepts - access to support material from {SAGE} study skills books. Statistics lecturers are also provided with a whole range of resources and teaching aids, including: - the test bank - over 300 multiple-choice questions ready to upload to {WebCT}, Blackboard or other virtual learning environments - charts and diagrams in electronic format for inclusion in lecture slides - {PowerPoint} slides written by the author to accompany chapters of the text.},

On the basis of an interactionist principle of trait activation (R. P. Tett \& H. A.

Trait-expressive work behavior is distinguished from (valued) job performance in clarifying the conditions favoring personality use in selection efforts. The model frames linkages between situational taxonomies (e.g., J. L. Holland's [1985] {RIASEC} model) and the Big Five and promotes useful discussion of critical issues, including situational specificity, personality-oriented job analysis, team building, and work motivation.},

The phenomenological analysis of the multiple {ASC} resulted in 4 dimensions by which they can be characterized: activation, awareness span, self-awareness, and sensory dynamics. The neurophysiological approach revealed that the different states of consciousness are mainly brought about by a compromised brain structure, transient changes in brain dynamics (disconnectivity), and neurochemical and metabolic processes. Besides these severe alterations, environmental stimuli, mental practices, and techniques of self-control can also temporarily alter brain functioning and conscious experience.},

Most of what is understood about trait mindfulness comes from administering the {MAAS} to relatively homogenous samples of Caucasian adults. This study rigorously evaluates the psychometric properties of the {MAAS} among Chinese adolescents attending high school in Chengdu, China. Classrooms from 24 schools were randomly selected to participate in the study. Three waves of longitudinal data (N = 5,287 students) were analyzed. {MAAS} construct, nomological, and incremental validity were evaluated as well as its measurement invariance across gender using latent factor analyses. Participants' mean age was 16.2 years ({SD} = 0.7), and 51\% were male. The 15-item {MAAS} had adequate fit to the one-dimensional factor structure at Wave 1, and this factor structure was replicated at Wave 2. A 6-item short scale of the {MAAS} fit well to the data at Wave 3. The {MAAS} maintained reliability (Cronbach's α = .89-.93; test--restest r = .35-.52), convergent/discriminant validity, and explained additional variance in mental health measures beyond other psychosocial constructs. Both the 15- and 6-item {MAAS} scales displayed at least partial factorial invariance across gender. The findings suggest that the {MAAS} is a sound measure of trait mindfulness among Chinese adolescents. To reduce respondent burden, the {MAAS} 6-item short-scale provides an option to measure trait mindfulness.},

The utility of mediation analysis stems from its ability to go beyond the merely descriptive to a more functional understanding of the relationships among variables. A necessary component of mediation is a statistically and practically significant indirect effect. Although mediation hypotheses are frequently explored in psychological research, formal significance tests of indirect effects are rarely conducted. After a brief overview of mediation, we argue the importance of directly testing the significance of indirect effects and provide {SPSS} and {SAS} macros that facilitate estimation of the indirect effect with a normal theory approach and a bootstrap approach to obtaining confidence intervals, as well as the traditional approach advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986). We hope that this discussion and the macros will enhance the frequency of formal mediation tests in the psychology literature.

This paper is the first of a three part series; and it aims to introduce unidimensional unfolding theory. The paper begins with a simple hypothetical example presenting an idealised distinction between responses to cumulative and unfolding dichotomous items. This followed by an accessible presentation of the theory of unidimensional unfolding as first articulated by Clyde H. Coombs (1950, 1964). The concept of the single peaked preference function (Coombs and Avrunin, 1977) which underpins unfolding theory is then presented. The article then progresses to the class of Rasch (1960) based {IRT} models developed by Andrich (1995) and Luo (2001). It was shown these models propose arguments not inconsistent with Coombs's (1964) original theory. The presumption of additive structure in psychological attributes was concluded to be the key weakness of the theories of unidimensional unfolding discussed.},

The two methods: (1) address the same kind of data, but with different interpretations of numerical status; (2) use the same estimation methods, but with different measurement models; and (3) solve the same problems, but with substantially different utility. Factor analysis is faulted for mistaking ordinally labeled stochastic observations for linear measures and for failing to construct linear measurement. The motivation and mathematical basis for Rasch measurement are introduced. How to use Rasch measurement to replace factor analysis is developed for a dichotomy and demonstrated for a rating scale.

In recent years, mindfulness meditation has been proposed to improve attention, reduce stress, and improve mood. This study tests the feasibility of an 8-week mindfulness training program for adults and adolescents with {ADHD}.

{METHOD}: Twenty-four adults and eight adolescents with {ADHD} enrolled in a feasibility study of an 8-week mindfulness training program.

{RESULTS}: The majority of participants completed the training and reported high satisfaction with the training. Pre-post improvements in self-reported {ADHD} symptoms and test performance on tasks measuring attention and cognitive inhibition were noted.

However, few of the available instruments have been thoroughly validated.: To adapt into French and to test the reliability and validity of a scale for measurement of attitudes towards guidelines developed by Elovainio et al.: A 27-item scale (divided into six dimensions) measuring attitudes towards guidelines was translated into French by two English native translators, reviewed and finalized by expert committee and administered to 314 practitioners who agreed to participate. Main practitioners' characteristics were collected. Item and dimension reproducibility were assessed for 62 practitioners by calculation of intraclass correlation coefficients. Internal construct validity was assessed by principal components analyses. Convergent and discriminant validity were analysed.: Item response rates ranged from 82 to 100\%. In the test-retest procedure, intraclass correlation coefficients for separate items ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 and those for dimensions were 0.7 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 0.5-0.8] for usefulness, 0.5 (0.3-0.6) for reliability, 0.4 (0.2-0.5) for individual competence, 0.5 (0.3-0.6) for organizational competence, 0.7 (0.5-0.8) for impracticality and 0.4 (0.3-0.6) for availability. The factorial structure after Varimax rotation showed that none of the different solutions obtained had a strictly comparable structure to that of the original scale. External construct validity was satisfactory.: This scale does not have satisfactory psychometric properties and therefore cannot confidently be used in future research assessing whether attitudes towards guidelines are a determining factor in physicians' compliance with guidelines. More research is needed to develop valid scales in a more rigorous procedure, involving qualitative and quantitative steps.},

Psoriasis status was assessed in three ways: direct inspection by unblinded clinic nurses; direct inspection by physicians blinded to the patient's study condition (tape or no-tape); and blinded physician evaluation of photographs of psoriasis lesions. Four sequential indicators of skin status were monitored during the study: a First Response Point, a Turning Point, a Halfway Point, and a Clearing Point. {RESULTS}: Cox-proportional hazards regression analysis showed that subjects in the tape groups reached the Halfway Point (p = .013) and the Clearing Point (p = .033) significantly more rapidly than those in the no-tape condition, for both {UVB} and {PUVA} treatments. {CONCLUSIONS}: A brief mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction intervention delivered by audiotape during ultraviolet light therapy can increase the rate of resolution of psoriatic lesions in patients with psoriasis.},

In this paper, we explain our choices for the design requirements and preferred statistical methods for which no evidence is available in the literature or on which the Delphi panel members had substantial discussion.

{METHODS}: The issues described in this paper are a reflection of the Delphi process in which 43 panel members participated.

{RESULTS}: The topics discussed are internal consistency (relevance for reflective and formative models, and distinction with unidimensionality), content validity (judging relevance and comprehensiveness), hypotheses testing as an aspect of construct validity (specificity of hypotheses), criterion validity (relevance for {PROs}), and responsiveness (concept and relation to validity, and (in) appropriate measures).

{CONCLUSIONS}: We expect that this paper will contribute to a better understanding of the rationale behind the items, thereby enhancing the acceptance and use of the {COSMIN} checklist.},

Although the benefits of practice tests are well documented, the mechanisms underlying testing effects are not well understood. We propose the mediator effectiveness hypothesis, which states that more-effective mediators (that is, information linking cues to targets) are generated during practice involving tests with restudy versus during restudy only. Effective mediators must be retrievable at time of test and must elicit the target response. We evaluated these two components of mediator effectiveness for learning foreign language translations during practice involving either test-restudy or restudy only. Supporting the mediator effectiveness hypothesis, test-restudy practice resulted in mediators that were more likely to be retrieved and more likely to elicit targets on a final test.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Pathological gambling is a behavioural addiction with negative economic, social, and psychological consequences. Identification of contributing genes and pathways may improve understanding of aetiology and facilitate therapy and prevention. Here, we report the first genome-wide association study of pathological gambling. Our aims were to identify pathways involved in pathological gambling, and examine whether there is a genetic overlap between pathological gambling and alcohol dependence. {METHODS} Four hundred and forty-five individuals with a diagnosis of pathological gambling according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders were recruited in Germany, and 986 controls were drawn from a German general population sample. A genome-wide association study of pathological gambling comprising single marker, gene-based, and pathway analyses, was performed. Polygenic risk scores were generated using data from a German genome-wide association study of alcohol dependence. {RESULTS} No genome-wide significant association with pathological gambling was found for single markers or genes. Pathways for Huntington's disease (P-value=6.63×10(-3)); 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signalling (P-value=9.57×10(-3)); and apoptosis (P-value=1.75×10(-2)) were significant. Polygenic risk score analysis of the alcohol dependence dataset yielded a one-sided nominal significant P-value in subjects with pathological gambling, irrespective of comorbid alcohol dependence status. {CONCLUSIONS} The present results accord with previous quantitative formal genetic studies which showed genetic overlap between non-substance- and substance-related addictions. Furthermore, pathway analysis suggests shared pathology between Huntington's disease and pathological gambling. This finding is consistent with previous imaging studies.},

	abstract = {In light of the upcoming eleventh edition of the International Classification of Diseases ({ICD}-11), the question arises as to the most appropriate classification of 'Pathological Gambling' ('{PG}'). Some academic opinion favors leaving {PG} in the 'Impulse Control Disorder' ('{ICD}') category, as in {ICD}-10, whereas others argue that new data especially from the neurobiological area favor allocating it to the category of 'Substance-related and Addictive Disorders' ('{SADs}'), following the decision in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The current review examines important findings in relation to {PG}, with the aim of enabling a well-informed decision to be made with respect to the classification of {PG} as a {SAD} or {ICD} in {ICD}-11. Particular attention is given to cognitive deficits and underlying neurobiological mechanisms that play a role in {SADs} and {ICDs}. These processes are impulsivity, compulsivity, reward/punishment processing and decision-making. In summary, the strongest arguments for subsuming {PG} under a larger {SAD} category relate to the existence of similar diagnostic characteristics; the high co-morbidity rates between the disorders; their common core features including reward-related aspects (positive reinforcement: behaviors are pleasurable at the beginning which is not the case for {ICDs}); the findings that the same brain structures are involved in {PG} and {SADs}, including the ventral striatum. Research on compulsivity suggests a relationship with {PG} and {SAD}, particularly in later stages of the disorders. Although research is limited for {ICDs}, current data do not support continuing to classify {PG} as an {ICD}.},

Conducting structural equation modeling we evaluated the contribution of reward-related personality traits, behavior, brain responses and candidate genes. Personality seems to be most important in explaining alcohol drinking in early adolescence. However, genetic variations in {ANKK}1 (rs1800497) and {HOMER}1 (rs7713917) play an equal role in predicting alcohol drinking two years later and are most important in predicting the increase in alcohol consumption.

	abstract = {The number of massively multiplayer online games ({MMOs}) is on the rise worldwide along with the fascination that they inspire. Problems occur when the use of {MMOs} becomes excessive at the expense of other life domains. Although not yet formally included as disorder in common diagnostic systems, internet gaming disorder ({IGD}) is considered a "condition for further study" in section {III} of the {DSM}-5. The current review aims to provide an overview of cognitive and neurobiological data currently available on {IGD}, with a particular focus on impulsivity, compulsivity, and sensitivity to reward and punishment. Additionally, we also compare these findings on {IGD} with data from studies on pathological gambling ({PG})-so far the only condition officially classified as a behavioral addiction in the {DSM}-5. Multiple similarities have been observed in the neurobiology of {IGD} and {PG}, as measured by alterations in brain function and behavior. Both patients with {IGD} and those with {PG} exhibited decreased loss sensitivity; enhanced reactivity to gaming and gambling cues, respectively; enhanced impulsive choice behavior; aberrant reward-based learning; and no changes in cognitive flexibility. In conclusion, the evidence base on the neurobiology of gaming and gambling disorders is beginning to illuminate the similarities between the two. However, as only a few studies have addressed the neurobiological basis of {IGD}, and some of these studies suffer from significant limitations, more research is required before {IGD}'s inclusion as a second behavioral addiction in the next versions of the {ICD} and {DSM} can be justified.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} While {DSM}-5 classified pathological gambling as an addictive disorder, there is debate as to whether {ICD}-11 should follow suit. The debate hinges on scientific evidence such as neurobiological findings, family history of psychiatric disorders, psychiatric comorbidity, and personality variables. {METHODS} In the "Baden-Württemberg Study of Pathological Gambling", we compared a group of 515 male pathological gamblers receiving treatment with 269 matched healthy controls. We studied differences in sociodemographic characteristics, gambling-related variables, psychiatric comorbidity (lifetime), family history of psychiatric conditions, as well as personality traits such as impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale), sensation seeking (Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale) and the {NEO}-{FFI} big five. Personality traits were validated in an age- and ethnicity-matched subsample of "pure" gamblers without any psychiatric comorbidity (including nicotine dependence). Data were analyzed using two-sample t-tests, Chi(2) analyses, Fisher's exact test and Pearson correlation analysis, as appropriate. Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. {RESULTS} Only 1\% of the gamblers had been diagnosed with an impulse control disorder other than gambling ({ICD}-10). Notably, 88\% of the gamblers in our sample had a comorbid diagnosis of substance dependence. The highest axis I comorbidity rate was for nicotine dependence (80\%), followed by alcohol dependence (28\%). Early age of first gambling experience was correlated with gambling severity. Compared to first-degree relatives of controls, first-degree relatives of pathological gamblers were more likely to suffer from alcohol dependence (27.0\% vs. 7.4\%), pathological gambling (8.3\% vs. 0.7\%) and suicide attempts (2.7\% vs. 0.4\%). Significant group differences were observed for the {NEO}-{FFI} factors neuroticism, agreeableness and conscientiousness. Gamblers were also more impulsive than controls, but did not differ from controls in terms of sensation seeking. {CONCLUSIONS} Our findings support classifying pathological gambling as a behavioural addiction in the {ICD}-11. This decision will have a significant impact on the approaches available for prevention (e.g. age limits) and treatment.},

Differences in these regions among competence/adversity subgroups were maintained after controlling for several covariates and were robust to alternative operationalization decisions for key constructs. {CONCLUSIONS} We demonstrate structural brain correlates of adolescent resilience, and suggest that right prefrontal structures are implicated in adaptive functioning for youth who have experienced adversity.},

Shorter time in bed during weekdays, and later weekend sleeping hours correlate with smaller brain grey matter volumes in frontal, anterior cingulate, and precuneus cortex regions. Poor school grade average associates with later weekend bedtime and smaller grey matter volumes in medial brain regions. The medial prefrontal - anterior cingulate cortex appears most tightly related to the adolescents' variations in sleep habits, as its volume correlates inversely with both weekend bedtime and wake up time, and also with poor school performance. These findings suggest that sleep habits, notably during the weekends, have an alarming link with both the structure of the adolescent brain and school performance, and thus highlight the need for informed interventions.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging in pathological gambling ({PG}) allows studying brain structure independent of pharmacological/neurotoxic effects occurring in substance addiction. Because of high comorbidity of {PG} with substance use disorder ({SUD}), first results on structural deficits in {PG} are controversial. The current investigation is the first to examine gray matter ({GM}) volume alterations in {PG} controlling for the impact of {SUD} by comparing non-comorbid ({PGPURE} ) and two comorbid ({PGALCOHOL} and {PGPOLY} ) groups. Two hundred and five individuals were included in the analysis: 107 patients diagnosed with {PG} and 98 healthy controls ({HCs}). We employed voxel-based morphometry to look for {GM} volume differences between the groups controlling for age, smoking and depression. {GM} decreases in the superior medial and orbital frontal cortex occur independently of substance use in {PGPURE} compared with {HCs}. The frontal pattern of {GM} decrease was comparable with {PGALCOHOL} group where additionally {GM} volume was decreased in the anterior cingulate but increased in the amygdala. Moreover, regions in {PGALCOHOL} + {POLY} with reduced {GM} volume were the medial frontal, anterior cingulate and occipital lobe regions. {PGALCOHOL} + {POLY} not only exhibited structural deficits in comparison with {HCs} but also relative to {PGPURE} in the precuneus and post-central gyrus. We demonstrated specific frontal cortex {GM} deficits in {PG} without {SUD} comorbidities. Whereas some target regions reported in earlier studies might result from comorbid substance abuse, there seems to be a core set of frontal alterations associated with addicted gambling behaviour independent of toxic substance effects.},

	abstract = {The growth rate of scientific publication has been studied from 1907 to 2007 using available data from a number of literature databases, including Science Citation Index ({SCI}) and Social Sciences Citation Index ({SSCI}). Traditional scientific publishing, that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50 years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for {SCI} up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that {SCI} was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by {SCI} is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that {SCI} has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in {SSCI} was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by {SSCI} was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on {SCI}, {SSCI} and Arts and Humanities Citation Index ({AHCI}). Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.},

This paper presents the first evidence-based guidelines for {AUD} from German-speaking countries. These guidelines are based on the work of delegates from a representative sample of 46 scientific societies (mostly medical) from Austria, Germany and Switzerland dealing with {AUD}. It also included patients and relatives. Recommendations were derived from a standardised hierarchical process involving quality controls drawn from existing guidelines, de novo literature searches and/or expert experience. Potential conflicts of interest were assessed yearly and led to exclusion from voting in specific areas. An overall cost of more than 400,000€ (for alcohol and tobacco guidelines) were exclusively covered by the participating societies and academic institutions. More than 100 recommendations on screening, diagnostics and treatment of {AUD} are outlined in this paper, and their scientific background is given in the online supplementary material.

Here we use a longitudinal design to track 144 novelty-seeking adolescents at age 14 and 16 to determine whether neural activity in response to anticipated rewards predicts problematic drug use. We find that diminished {BOLD} activity in mesolimbic (ventral striatal and midbrain) and prefrontal cortical (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) regions during reward anticipation at age 14 predicts problematic drug use at age 16. Lower psychometric conscientiousness and steeper discounting of future rewards at age 14 also predicts problematic drug use at age 16, but the neural responses independently predict more variance than psychometric measures. Together, these findings suggest that diminished neural responses to anticipated rewards in novelty-seeking adolescents may increase vulnerability to future problematic drug use.},

	abstract = {Effect size information is essential for the scientific enterprise and plays an increasingly central role in the scientific process. We extracted 147,328 correlations and developed a hierarchical taxonomy of variables reported in Journal of Applied Psychology and Personnel Psychology from 1980 to 2010 to produce empirical effect size benchmarks at the omnibus level, for 20 common research domains, and for an even finer grained level of generality. Results indicate that the usual interpretation and classification of effect sizes as small, medium, and large bear almost no resemblance to findings in the field, because distributions of effect sizes exhibit tertile partitions at values approximately one-half to one-third those intuited by Cohen (1988). Our results offer information that can be used for research planning and design purposes, such as producing better informed non-nil hypotheses and estimating statistical power and planning sample size accordingly. We also offer information useful for understanding the relative importance of the effect sizes found in a particular study in relationship to others and which research domains have advanced more or less, given that larger effect sizes indicate a better understanding of a phenomenon. Also, our study offers information about research domains for which the investigation of moderating effects may be more fruitful and provide information that is likely to facilitate the implementation of Bayesian analysis. Finally, our study offers information that practitioners can use to evaluate the relative effectiveness of various types of interventions.},

We introduce p-curve as a way to answer this question. P-curve is the distribution of statistically significant p values for a set of studies (ps {\textless} .05). Because only true effects are expected to generate right-skewed p-curves-containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p values--only right-skewed p--curves are diagnostic of evidential value. By telling us whether we can rule out selective reporting as the sole explanation for a set of findings, p-curve offers a solution to the age-old inferential problems caused by file-drawers of failed studies and analyses.},

	abstract = {The scientific interest in meditation and mindfulness practice has recently seen an unprecedented surge. After an initial phase of presenting beneficial effects of mindfulness practice in various domains, research is now seeking to unravel the underlying psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms. Advances in understanding these processes are required for improving and fine-tuning mindfulness-based interventions that target specific conditions such as eating disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. This review presents a theoretical framework that emphasizes the central role of attentional control mechanisms in the development of mindfulness skills. It discusses the phenomenological level of experience during meditation, the different attentional functions that are involved, and relates these to the brain networks that subserve these functions. On the basis of currently available empirical evidence specific processes as to how attention exerts its positive influence are considered and it is concluded that meditation practice appears to positively impact attentional functions by improving resource allocation processes. As a result, attentional resources are allocated more fully during early processing phases which subsequently enhance further processing. Neural changes resulting from a pure form of mindfulness practice that is central to most mindfulness programs are considered from the perspective that they constitute a useful reference point for future research. Furthermore, possible interrelations between the improvement of attentional control and emotion regulation skills are discussed.},

N = 80 participants worked on solving tasks of an intelligence test. Half of them learned that there was a positive correlation between intelligence and life satisfaction. The remaining half did not receive any information of that kind. Those participants who were suggested a relation between intelligence and life satisfaction anticipated stronger positive emotions in the case of a successful test result respectively stronger negative emotions in the case of an unsuccessful test result than did participants who were not given that kind of information, which yielded higher persistence in working on the task. Both in cases of a successful test result and of an unsuccessful test result, the felt affects after task completion were not as strong as participants had anticipated before working on the task.

The advantage of visual data exploration is that the user is directly involved in the data mining process. There is a large number of information visualization techniques which have been developed over the last decade to support the exploration of large data sets. In this paper, we propose a classification of information visu- alization and visual data mining techniques which is based on the data type to be visualized, the visualization technique and the interaction and distortion technique. We exemplify the clas- sification using a few examples, most of them referring to techniques and systems presented in this special issue},

After filling in the questionnaire, all participants received an application to be installed on their smartphones, which recorded their phone usage for five weeks. The analyses revealed that weekly phone usage in hours was overestimated; in contrast, numbers of call and text message related variables were underestimated. Importantly, several associations between actual usage and being addicted to mobile phones could be derived exclusively from the recorded behavior, but not from self-report variables.

(i) To develop a reliable and valid scale to measure in-patient and outpatient perceptions of quality in India and (ii) to identify aspects of perceived quality which have large effects on patient satisfaction. {DESIGN}: Cross-sectional survey of health facilities and patients at clinics. {SETTING}: Primary health centers, community health centers, district hospitals, and female district hospitals in the state of Uttar Pradesh in north India. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Internal consistency, validity, and factor structure of the scale are evaluated. The association between patient satisfaction and perceived quality dimensions is examined. {RESULTS}: A 16-item scale having good reliability and validity is developed. Five dimensions of perceived quality are identified-medicine availability, medical information, staff behavior, doctor behavior, and hospital infrastructure. Patient perceptions of quality at public health facilities are slightly better than neutral. Multivariate regression analysis results indicate that for outpatients, doctor behavior has the largest effect on general patient satisfaction followed by medicine availability, hospital infrastructure, staff behavior, and medical information. For in-patients, staff behavior has the largest effect followed by doctor behavior, medicine availability, medical information, and hospital infrastructure. {CONCLUSIONS}: The scale developed can be used to measure perceived quality at a range of facility types for outpatients and in-patients. Perceived quality at public facilities is only marginally favorable, leaving much scope for improvement. Better staff and physician interpersonal skills, facility infrastructure, and availability of drugs have the largest effect in improving patient satisfaction at public health facilities.},

	abstract = {The German Observational Study of Adult Twins ({GOSAT}) is the largest population-based observational twin study in Germany to date. Embedded in the Bielefeld Longitudinal Study of Adult Twins ({BiLSAT}), it addresses the etiology of personality, temperament and cognitive ability in a sample of 300 monozygotic ({MZ}) and dizygotic ({DZ}) adult twin pairs between 18 and 70 years of age. A major aim of the {GOSAT} lies in the utilization of different modes of measurement, (i.e., peer reports and observational data), in addition to self-reports which have been used predominantly in past behavioral genetic research on personality and temperament in adults. Participants completed a full day assessment at the University of Bielefeld including videotaped social interactions and presentations, psychometric intelligence tests and computerized elementary cognitive tasks as well as objective measures and unobtrusive behavior counts. The research design of the {GOSAT} was devised to reduce the potential impact of systematic rater bias on estimates of genetic and environmental influences to a minimum. In combination with extensive self- and peer report data on key personality and personality related dimensions available from the {BiLSAT}, the {GOSAT} provides a rich dataset, which currently includes {DNA} samples from 80\% of its participants.},

Design and interventions: Patients were randomly allocated to outpatient hysteroscopy or day case hysteroscopy provided they had no preference for either procedure. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Satisfaction rate, requirements for postoperative analgesia, speed of recovery, time away from home, and time off work. {RESULTS}: The outpatient group recovered preoperative fitness more quickly than the day case group (2 days (range 1-2.7) versus 3 days (2-4), P{\textless}0.05). After the procedure, the outpatient group were also fully mobile more quickly than the day case group (0 minutes (0-5) versus 105 minutes (80-120), P{\textless}0.001). Requirements for postoperative analgesia were similar in both groups. Overall, 78\% of patients considered that the pain from outpatient hysteroscopy was less than that usually experienced during menstruation. Patient satisfaction was similar in both groups (83.6\% in the outpatient group versus 77.0\% in the day case group). {CONCLUSIONS}: Outpatient hysteroscopy and day case hysteroscopy were equally acceptable to patients.

The mechanical method involves a formal, algorithmic, objective procedure (e.g., equation) to reach the decision. Empirical comparisons of the accuracy of the two methods (136 studies over a wide range of predictands) show that the mechanical method is almost invariably equal to or superior to the clinical method: Common antiactuarial arguments are rebutted, possible causes of widespread resistance to the comparative research are offered, and policy implications of the statistical method's superiority are discussed.},

	abstract = {Mindfulness meditation practices ({MMPs}) are a subgroup of meditation practices which are receiving growing attention. The present paper reviews current evidence about the effects of {MMPs} on objective measures of cognitive functions. Five databases were searched. Twenty three studies providing measures of attention, memory, executive functions and further miscellaneous measures of cognition were included. Fifteen were controlled or randomized controlled studies and 8 were case-control studies. Overall, reviewed studies suggested that early phases of mindfulness training, which are more concerned with the development of focused attention, could be associated with significant improvements in selective and executive attention whereas the following phases, which are characterized by an open monitoring of internal and external stimuli, could be mainly associated with improved unfocused sustained attention abilities. Additionally, {MMPs} could enhance working memory capacity and some executive functions. However, many of the included studies show methodological limitations and negative results have been reported as well, plausibly reflecting differences in study design, study duration and patients' populations. Accordingly, even though findings here reviewed provided preliminary evidence suggesting that {MMPs} could enhance cognitive functions, available evidence should be considered with caution and further high quality studies investigating more standardized mindfulness meditation programs are needed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Nurses and nursing support staff increasingly require computers to carry out their work. Minimum computer competencies for nurses have been identified. The determination of whether the current nursing workforce has acquired these competencies remains uncertain. We administered a self-assessment survey to nurses and nursing support staff to determine proficiency with computer skills they might perform at work. Respondents reported inadequacies in basic and work-related computer skills. More than 28\% scored themselves as having fair or poor proficiency on all skills, and more than 50\% as fair or poor on five of 11 skills. Respondents over age 50 and those graduating before 1984 tended to score proficiency lower.

	abstract = {For the first time in history, it is possible to study human behavior on great scale and in fine detail simultaneously. Online services and ubiquitous computational devices, such as smartphones and modern cars, record our everyday activity. The resulting Big Data offers unprecedented opportunities for tracking and analyzing behavior. This paper hypothesizes the applicability and impact of Big Data technologies in the context of psychometrics both for research and clinical applications. It first outlines the state of the art, including the severe shortcomings with respect to quality and quantity of the resulting data. It then presents a technological vision, comprised of (i) numerous data sources such as mobile devices and sensors, (ii) a central data store, and (iii) an analytical platform, employing techniques from data mining and machine learning. To further illustrate the dramatic benefits of the proposed methodologies, the paper then outlines two current projects, logging and analyzing smartphone usage. One such study attempts to thereby quantify severity of major depression dynamically; the other investigates (mobile) Internet Addiction. Finally, the paper addresses some of the ethical issues inherent to Big Data technologies. In summary, the proposed approach is about to induce the single biggest methodological shift since the beginning of psychology or psychiatry. The resulting range of applications will dramatically shape the daily routines of researches and medical practitioners alike. Indeed, transferring techniques from computer science to psychiatry and psychology is about to establish Psycho-Informatics, an entire research direction of its own. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This basic procedure was run under three different conditions: (a) subjects did not know the stimuli before, (b) subjects knew them from a foregoing psychophysical experiment, (c) the same, with reinforcing the golden section. The rectangles at both extremes of each range were chosen first most often under the first two conditions, whereas the golden section was chosen most often under the last condition. The conclusion is that preference for the golden section is an artifact of the stimulus range and of the demand characteristics of the experimental procedure rather than of any intrinsic aesthetic quality.},

In Study 2, the unidimensionality of the P Scale was corroborated with confirmatory factor analysis in 2 independent samples (N₁ = 322; N₂ = 457). In Study 3, P Scale invariance across sexes and its relations with self-esteem, life satisfaction, optimism, positive negative affect, depression, and the Big Five provided further evidence of the internal and construct validity of the new measure in a large community sample (N = 3,589). In Study 4, test-retest reliability of the P Scale was found in a sample of college students (N = 262) who were readministered the scale after 5 weeks.

The current work further investigated neural substrates of self-referential processing in Chinese Buddhists. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 14 Chinese Buddhists, while they conducted trait judgments of the self, Zhu Rongji (the former Chinese premier), Sakyamuni (the Buddhist leader) and Jesus (the Christian leader). We found that, relative to Zhu Rongji judgment, self-judgment in Buddhist participants failed to generate increased activation in the {VMPFC} but induced increased activations in the {DMPFC}/rostral anterior cingulate cortex, midcingulate and the left frontal/insular cortex. Self-judgment was also associated with decreased functional connectivity between the {DMPFC} and posterior parietal cortex compared with Zhu Rongji judgment. The results suggest that Buddhist doctrine of No-self results in weakened neural coding of stimulus self-relatedness in the {VMPFC}, but enhanced evaluative processes of self-referential stimuli in the {DMPFC}. Moreover, self-referential processing in Buddhists is characterized by monitoring the conflict between the doctrine of No-self and self-focus thinking during self-trait judgment.},

Additional information is provided with reference to a selection of the literature. {RESULTS}: Factors that may bias the results of observational studies can be broadly categorized as: selection bias resulting from the way study subjects are recruited or from differing rates of study participation depending on the subjects' cultural background, age, or socioeconomic status, information bias, measurement error, confounders, and further factors. {CONCLUSIONS}: Observational studies make an important contribution to medical knowledge. The main methodological problems can be avoided by careful study planning. An understanding of the potential pitfalls is important in order to critically assess relevant publications.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To examine the psychometric validity and reliability of the incident reporting culture questionnaire ({IRCQ}; in Chinese) following an exploration of the reporting culture perceived by hospital nurses in Taiwan. {DESIGN}: Scale development with psychometric examination and a cross-sectional study. {SETTING}: Ten teaching hospitals. {PARTICIPANTS}: A total of 1064 nurses participated with an average response rate of 83\% between November 2008 and June 2009. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The factorial construct, criterion-related validity, homogeneity and stability of the {IRCQ} were evaluated. The nurses' perceptions of the {IRCQ} were also explored. {RESULTS}: The four-factor structure of the 20-item {IRCQ} had satisfactory construct validity (explained variance: 49.37\%), criterion-related validity (r = 0.42; P = 0.001), reliability (Cronbach's alpha: 0.83) and stability (3-week-interval correlation: r = 0.80; P = 0.001). These factors included 'application of learning from errors', 'readiness to provide feedback on incident reports', 'collegial atmospheres of unpleasantness and punishment' ({CA}) and 'incident management: confidential and system driven'. The nurses perceived a moderate overall reporting culture (mean positive response = 49.25\%; range: 67.2-24.94\%). They weakly agreed on the {CA} factor of five items (mean positive response = 24.94\%; range: 33.0-17.2\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: This study provides empirical evidence for the psychometric properties of the {IRCQ} and the reporting culture which nurses perceive in Taiwan. To Taiwanese nurses, the reporting culture within their work environments especially as it relates to coworker relations, inter-professional collaboration and non-punitive atmosphere is their major concern. Healthcare administrators should consider nurses' perceptions related to incident reporting when managing underreporting issues.},

	abstract = {With a rapidly aging society it becomes increasingly important to counter normal age-related decline in cognitive functioning. Growing evidence suggests that cognitive training programs may have the potential to counteract this decline. On the basis of a growing body of research that shows that meditation has positive effects on cognition in younger and middle-aged adults, meditation may be able to offset normal age-related cognitive decline or even enhance cognitive function in older adults. In this paper, we review studies investigating the effects of meditation on age-related cognitive decline. We searched the Web of Science (1900 to present), {PsycINFO} (1597 to present), {MEDLINE} (1950 to present), and {CABI} (1910 to present) to identify original studies investigating the effects of meditation on cognition and cognitive decline in the context of aging. Twelve studies were included in the review, six of which were randomized controlled trials. Studies involved a wide variety of meditation techniques and reported preliminary positive effects on attention, memory, executive function, processing speed, and general cognition. However, most studies had a high risk of bias and small sample sizes. Reported dropout rates were low and compliance rates high. We conclude that meditation interventions for older adults are feasible, and preliminary evidence suggests that meditation can offset age-related cognitive decline.},

Systematic literature reviews, meta-analyses of published data, and meta-analyses of individual data (pooled reanalyses) are now being published with increasing frequency. We here describe the essential features of these methods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.: This article is based on a selective literature search. The different types of review and meta-analysis are described, the methods used in each are outlined so that they can be evaluated, and a checklist is given for the assessment of reviews and meta-analyses of scientific articles.: Systematic literature reviews provide an overview of the state of research on a given topic and enable an assessment of the quality of individual studies. They also allow the results of different studies to be evaluated together when these are inconsistent. Meta-analyses additionally allow calculation of pooled estimates of an effect. The different types of review and meta-analysis are discussed with examples from the literature on one particular topic.: Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses enable the research findings and treatment effects obtained in different individual studies to be summed up and evaluated.},

It draws upon detailed qualitative research on single parent and young elderly households to explore what counts as experiences of inclusion or exclusion and the processes behind them. Dealing mainly, but not exclusively, with the more traditional {ICTs} of telephony and broadcasting, the article considers processes of self-exclusion as people have mixed evaluations of these technologies derived both from current circumstances and past experiences. It then looks beyond the acquisition of {ICTs} to show how other modes of access to these resources are important before reflecting upon the quality of experience of {ICTs}, not just in terms of the functionality on offer but also taking into account that technologies are themselves symbolic goods. Finally, and drawing on more recent research, the article asks what lessons might be learnt from these traditional {ICTs} when considering newly emerging ones like the internet.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction ({LLE}), supercritical fluid extraction ({SFE}), solid phase extraction ({SPE}), (b) separation methods such as ({TLC}), high performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}), gas chromatography ({GC}), and capillary electrophoresis ({CE}) and (c) others such as {ELISA}.

	abstract = {The standard model of labor is one in which individuals trade their time and energy in return for monetary rewards. Building on Fiske's relational theory (1992), we propose that there are two types of markets that determine relationships between effort and payment: monetary and social. We hypothesize that monetary markets are highly sensitive to the magnitude of compensation, whereas social markets are not. This perspective can shed light on the well-established observation that people sometimes expend more effort in exchange for no payment (a social market) than they expend when they receive low payment (a monetary market). Three experiments support these ideas. The experimental evidence also demonstrates that mixed markets (markets that include aspects of both social and monetary markets) more closely resemble monetary than social markets.},

In our questionnaire-based study, comprising the data of 587 undergraduate students we examined the association between trait anxiety, perceived stress, trait mindfulness, negative dream affect and dream anxiety. Our results indicate that mindfulness is inversely related to disturbed dreaming and predicts less severe dream disturbances after controlling for trait anxiety. Moreover, the results of the applied hierarchical regression analysis suggest that mindfulness is associated with reduced dream anxiety by moderating the extent of waking anxiety. Our findings extend previous research relating mindfulness, emotional regulation and sleep quality to the domain of dream research. We suggest that mindfulness is a possible protective factor against dream disturbances.},

	abstract = {Psychometricians hypothesize that cognitive abilities such as reading, writing and spelling are measurable. However, they prefer to model item response probabilities than to study the internal structure of cognitive attributes. The theory of conjoint measurement, via its unique capacity to detect the quantitative structure of non-extensive attributes, can be used for the latter purpose. It is shown that conjoint systems analogous to the numerical composition rules advanced by the Rasch, many facet Rasch and two-parameter logistic models can be formulated using well-established axioms, representation theorems and proofs. Examples using empirical and synthetic data are presented. It was concluded that the lack of descriptive, behavioural theory remains the biggest obstacle to the scientific measurement of cognitive abilities.},

While much attention has been paid to participants' outcomes, little work has been published concerning processes underlying improvements. Herein, women who had finished medical treatment for breast cancer completed questionnaires pre- and post-{MBSR} and were interviewed using focus group methodology such that quantitative and qualitative data were combined to explore potential mechanisms underlying changes. It was found that the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale was a useful process measure to assess changes in mindfulness and that the Coping with Health Injuries and Problems questionnaire was useful in documenting changes in palliative (self-care) coping over the course of the 8 week program. Moreover, the Sense of Coherence questionnaire suggested that the women viewed life as more meaningful and manageable following {MSBR}. Our findings fit with Shapiro et al.'s theory that, over time, participants in an {MBSR} program "reperceive" what they encounter in their daily experiences.},

In the scarce condition, the cookies were either constantly scarce or they began in abundant supply and then decreased. Ss were told that this decrease in supply was either due to an accident or to a high demand for the cookies. In the abundant condition, the cookies were either constantly abundant or first scarce and then abundant. The increase in supply was either due to an accident or to a lack of demand for the cookies. These conditions were crossed with a manipulation in which Ss thought either a high or low number of additional Ss were still to participate in the study. Results indicate that (a) cookies in scarce supply were rated as more desirable than cookies in abundant supply; (b) cookies were rated as more valuable when their supply changed from abundant to scarce than when they were constantly scarce; and (c) cookies scarce because of high demand were rated higher than cookies that were scarce because of an accident. With regard to abundance, cookies that were constantly abundant were rated higher than cookies that began scarce but later became abundant. Results extend commodity theory. Reactance was hypothesized as an intervening process responsible for some of the results. The 2nd study was performed to rule out the possibility that demand characteristics were responsible for the obtained results. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2006 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The ability to estimate the passage of time is of fundamental importance for perceptual and cognitive processes. One experience of time is the perception of duration, which is not isomorphic to physical duration and can be distorted by a number of factors. Yet, the critical features generating these perceptual shifts in subjective duration are not understood.

{METHODOLOGY}/{FINDINGS}: We used prospective duration judgments within and across sensory modalities to examine the effect of stimulus predictability and feature change on the perception of duration. First, we found robust distortions of perceived duration in auditory, visual and auditory-visual presentations despite the predictability of the feature changes in the stimuli. For example, a looming disc embedded in a series of steady discs led to time dilation, whereas a steady disc embedded in a series of looming discs led to time compression. Second, we addressed whether visual (auditory) inputs could alter the perception of duration of auditory (visual) inputs. When participants were presented with incongruent audio-visual stimuli, the perceived duration of auditory events could be shortened or lengthened by the presence of conflicting visual information; however, the perceived duration of visual events was seldom distorted by the presence of auditory information and was never perceived shorter than their actual durations.

{CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: These results support the existence of multisensory interactions in the perception of duration and, importantly, suggest that vision can modify auditory temporal perception in a pure timing task. Insofar as distortions in subjective duration can neither be accounted for by the unpredictability of an auditory, visual or auditory-visual event, we propose that it is the intrinsic features of the stimulus that critically affect subjective time distortions.},

Functional analysis is tightly connected to treatment but has failed to develop testable, replicable classification systems.

A wide range of research is reviewed showing that many forms of psychopathology can be conceptualized as unhealthy efforts to escape and avoid emotions, thoughts, memories, and other private experiences. It is argued that experiential avoidance, as a functional diagnostic dimension, has the potential to integrate the efforts and findings of researchers from a wide variety of theoretical paradigms, research interests, and clinical domains and to lead to testable new approaches to the analysis and treatment of behavioral disorders.},

	abstract = {Objective To review research into patient satisfaction with teleconsultation, specifically clinical consultations between healthcare providers and patients involving real time interactive video. Design Systematic review of telemedicine satisfaction studies. Electronic databases searched include Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts and Humanities Citation Index, and the {TIE} (Telemedicine Information Exchange) database. Subjects Studies conducted worldwide and published between 1966 and 1998. Main outcome measures Quality of evidence about patient satisfaction. Results 32 studies were identified. Study methods used were simple survey instruments (26 studies), exact methods not specified (5), and qualitative methods (1). Study designs were randomised controlled trial (1 trial); random patient selection (2); case-control (1); and selection criteria not specified or participants represented consecutive referrals, convenience samples, or volunteers (28). Sample sizes were ≤ 20 (10 trials), ≤ 100 (14), {\textgreater}100 (7), and not specified (1). All studies reported good levels of patient satisfaction. Qualitative analysis revealed methodological problems with all the published work. Even so, important issues were highlighted that merit further investigation. There is a paucity of data examining patients' perceptions or the effects of this mode of healthcare delivery on the interaction between providers and clients. Conclusions Methodological deficiencies (low sample sizes, context, and study designs) of the published research limit the generalisability of the findings. The studies suggest that teleconsultation is acceptable to patients in a variety of circumstances, but issues relating to patient satisfaction require further exploration from the perspective of both clients and providers.},

This is done on the basis of a selective literature search concerning study types in medical research, in addition to the authors' own experience. {RESULTS}: Three main areas of medical research can be distinguished by study type: basic (experimental), clinical, and epidemiological research. Furthermore, clinical and epidemiological studies can be further subclassified as either interventional or noninterventional. {CONCLUSIONS}: The study type that can best answer the particular research question at hand must be determined not only on a purely scientific basis, but also in view of the available financial resources, staffing, and practical feasibility (organization, medical prerequisites, number of patients, etc.).},

To describe the development of the Patient Experiences Questionnaire ({PEQ}) and to evaluate reliability and validity of constructed summed rating scales. {DESIGN}: Literature review, focus groups and pilot surveys. Two national cross-sectional studies performed in 1996 and 1998. {SETTING}: Two postal surveys in a national sample of 14 hospitals stratified by geographical region and hospital size. Subjects. Patients consecutively discharged from surgical wards and wards of internal medicine. The surveys included 36 845 patients and 19 578 responded (53\%). {RESULTS}: We constructed 10 summed rating scales based on factor analysis and theoretical considerations: Information on future complaints, Nursing services, Communication, Information examinations, Contact with next-of-kin, Doctor services, Hospital and equipment, Information medication, Organization and General satisfaction. Eight scales had a Cronbach alpha coefficient of {\textgreater}0.70, the remaining two were {\textgreater}0.60. Repeatability was {\textgreater}0.70 for five scales and {\textgreater}0.60 for the remaining scales. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {PEQ} is a self-report instrument covering the most important subjects of interest to hospital patients. Results are presented as 10 scales with good validity and reliability. It emphasizes practicability and comprehensibility while at the same time providing sufficient information about domains applicable to most patients admitted to medical and surgical wards.},

Here we examine the effect of sexual arousal, induced by self-stimulation, on judgments and hypothetical decisions made by male college students. Students were assigned to be in either a state of sexual arousal or a neutral state and were asked to: (1) indicate how appealing they find a wide range of sexual stimuli and activities, (2) report their willingness to engage in morally questionable behavior in order to obtain sexual gratification, and (3) describe their willingness to engage in unsafe sex when sexually aroused. The results show that sexual arousal had a strong impact on all three areas of judgment and decision making, demonstrating the importance of situational forces on preferences, as well as subjects' inability to predict these},

A questionnaire was developed to measure each of the expanded {TRA} model components. A sample was identified of 946 women age 40 and above who were invited to obtain a mammogram at the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound Breast Cancer Screening Program ({BCSP}). The sample was stratified by risk category as determined by the screening program. The study questionnaire was administered to all women in the sample within 2 weeks after they were sent the invitation to obtain a mammogram. Mammography participation was obtained from the {BCSP} data base 6 months after the invitation. Regression analyses found attitude, affect, subjective norm, and facilitating conditions to all be significantly associated with participation. The expanded {TRA} model explained 39\% of the variance in women's intentions and 20\% of the variance in participation behavior. A stepwise hierarchical regression found that no other psychosocial measures were able to improve the model predictions of behavior. An interaction between habit and intention was found such that women with larger numbers of previous mammograms were less likely to carry out their intentions than women with fewer previous mammograms. Contrary to expectations, some demographic characteristics did significantly improve prediction. The need for further work investigating the roles of fear and experience is discussed.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Satisfaction is considered a valuable measure of outcome of healthcare processes. Only a few anesthesia-related validated questionnaires are reported. Because their scope is restricted to specific clinical contexts, their use remains limited. The objective of the current study was to develop and validate a self-reported questionnaire, Evaluation du Vecu de l'Anesthesie Generale ({EVAN}-G), assessing the satisfaction of the perioperative period surrounding general anesthesia. {METHODS}: Development of the {EVAN}-G questionnaire comprised a phase of item generation and a phase of psychometric validation. The patient sample was generated to be proportionally matched to the population of patients undergoing general anesthesia in France. The structure of the questionnaire was identified studying interitem, item-dimension, and interdimension correlations and factor analyses. Data were concurrently gathered to assess external validity. The discriminant validity was determined by comparison of scores across well known patient groups. Reliability was assessed by computation of Cronbach alpha coefficients and by test-retest. {RESULTS}: Eight hundred seventy-four patients were recruited in eight anesthesia departments. The {EVAN}-G includes 26 items; six specific scores and one global index score are available. Correlations between {EVAN}-G scores and other concurrent measures supported convergent validity. The {EVAN}-G correlated poorly with age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, total anesthesia time, and number of previous anesthesias. Significantly higher satisfaction was reported by patients older than 65 yr, belonging to the laryngeal mask group. Reliability and reproducibility were shown. {CONCLUSION}: The {EVAN}-G adds important information oriented toward patients' perceptions. The authors' approach provides a novel, valid, and reliable tool that may be used in anesthesia practice.},

	abstract = {The last decade has seen a burgeoning of reports associating brain structure with specific skills and traits (e.g., [1-8]). Although these cross-sectional studies are informative, cause and effect are impossible to establish without longitudinal investigation of the same individuals before and after an intervention. Several longitudinal studies have been conducted (e.g., [9-18]); some involved children or young adults, potentially conflating brain development with learning, most were restricted to the motor domain, and all concerned relatively short timescales (weeks or months). Here, by contrast, we utilized a unique opportunity to study average-{IQ} adults operating in the real world as they learned, over four years, the complex layout of London's streets while training to become licensed taxi drivers. In those who qualified, acquisition of an internal spatial representation of London was associated with a selective increase in gray matter ({GM}) volume in their posterior hippocampi and concomitant changes to their memory profile. No structural brain changes were observed in trainees who failed to qualify or control participants. We conclude that specific, enduring, structural brain changes in adult humans can be induced by biologically relevant behaviors engaging higher cognitive functions such as spatial memory, with significance for the "nature versus nurture" debate. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

A self-report measure of student self-efficacy, intrinsic value, test anxiety, self-regulation, and use of learning strategies was administered, and performance data were obtained from work on classroom assignments. Self-efficacy and intrinsic value were positively related to cognitive engagement and performance. Regression analyses revealed that, depending on the outcome measure, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and test anxiety emerged as the best predictors of performance. Intrinsic value did not have a direct influence on performance but was strongly related to self-regulation and cognitive strategy use, regardless of prior achievement level. The implications of individual differences in motivational orientation for cognitive engagement and self-regulation in the classroom are discussed.},

In its therapeutic forms, mindfulness interventions promote increased tolerance of negative affect and improved well-being. However, the neural mechanisms underlying mindful mood regulation are poorly understood. Mindfulness training appears to enhance focused attention, supported by the anterior cingulate cortex and the lateral prefrontal cortex ({PFC}). In emotion regulation, these {PFC} changes promote the stable recruitment of a nonconceptual sensory pathway, an alternative to conventional attempts to cognitively reappraise negative emotion. In neural terms, the transition to nonconceptual awareness involves reducing evaluative processing, supported by midline structures of the {PFC}. Instead, attentional resources are directed toward a limbic pathway for present-moment sensory awareness, involving the thalamus, insula, and primary sensory regions. In patients with affective disorders, mindfulness training provides an alternative to cognitive efforts to control negative emotion, instead directing attention toward the transitory nature of momentary experience. Limiting cognitive elaboration in favour of momentary awareness appears to reduce automatic negative self-evaluation, increase tolerance for negative affect and pain, and help to engender self-compassion and empathy in people with chronic dysphoria.},

Main outcome measure Numerical scale of client perceptions of service quality. {RESULTS}: Clients report relatively high levels of perceived quality in Afghanistan. Most of the variation that is explained relates specifically to the patient's interaction with the health worker and not to other health facility characteristics, such as cleanliness, infrastructure, service capacity and the presence of equipment or drugs. The strongest determinants of client-perceived quality identified are health worker thoroughness in taking patient histories, conducting physical examinations and communicating with patients. Being seen by a doctor and being from a household in the poorest quintile are also associated with higher perceived quality. For female patients, being seen by a female provider is associated with higher perceived quality, while for male patients time and money spent for travel to the health facility are negatively associated with perceived quality. {CONCLUSIONS}: Clinical quality and client perceived quality appear to be mutually reinforcing, and efforts to improve health worker performance in taking histories, conducting exams and communicating with patients are likely to increase client perceived quality in this setting. Client perceptions of service quality assume additional importance in Afghanistan, where the perceived legitimacy of the government may depend partially on its ability to convince the population that it can deliver essential health services.},

Dieses Buch ist Einführung in und Arbeitsbuch für die Durchführung von Delphi-Befragungen. Der Autor gibt Anleitungen für das adäquate Design der vier etablierten Befragungstypen (Aggregation von Ideen, Strukturierung eines diffusen Sachverhalts, Qualifizierung von Expertenmeinungen, Schaffung eines Konsenses unter den Experten). Dabei stellt er jeweils alle wichtigen Aspekte des Verfahrens detailliert dar, zum Beispiel die Auswahl der Teilnehmer, die Erstellung des Fragebogens, die Gestaltung des Feed-backs und die Analyse der gewonnenen Daten. Darüber hinaus soll der Band die von Kritikern oft eingeforderte theoretische Fundierung des Verfahrens liefern. Basis dazu sind kognitionspsychologische Überlegungen und empirische Befunde zur Evaluation des Delphi-Ansatzes.

	abstract = {Working memory ({WM}) is a cognitive system that strongly relates to a person's ability to reason with novel information and direct attention to goal-relevant information. Due to the central role that {WM} plays in general cognition, it has become the focus of a rapidly growing training literature that seeks to affect broad cognitive change through prolonged training on {WM} tasks. Recent work has suggested that the effects of {WM} training extend to general fluid intelligence, attentional control, and reductions in symptoms of {ADHD}. We present a theoretically motivated perspective of {WM} and subsequently review the {WM} training literature in light of several concerns. These include (a) the tendency for researchers to define change to abilities using single tasks, (b) inconsistent use of valid {WM} tasks, (c) no-contact control groups, and (d) subjective measurement of change. The literature review highlights several findings that warrant further research but ultimately concludes that there is a need to directly demonstrate that {WM} capacity increases in response to training. Specifically, we argue that transfer of training to {WM} must be demonstrated using a wider variety of tasks, thus eliminating the possibility that results can be explained by task specific learning. Additionally, we express concern that many of the most promising results (e.g., increased intelligence) cannot be readily attributed to changes in {WM} capacity. Thus, a critical goal for future research is to uncover the mechanisms that lead to transfer of training. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

	abstract = {Background: Mindfulness may be viewed as a supra-cognitive state of consciousness focussed on the decentred, objective and compassionate observation of transient mental and physical phenomena that may be attained through meditation practices. Mindfulness meditation is thought to be beneficial in the management of various physical and mental health conditions. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation practice as a healthcare intervention. Methods: Systematic computerised and hand literature searches for randomised controlled trials and evaluation using methodological quality criteria. Results: The higher quality studies analysed in this review have demonstrated replicated statistically significant improvements in spirituality and positive health measures and decreases in depressive relapse, depressive recurrence and psychological distress. Conclusions: Despite the lack of specific, reliable and validated mindfulness measures, mindfulness shows potential as a positive healthcare intervention and continued investigation is warranted. Further research using improved methodology and utilising specific mindfulness outcome measures in trials with long-term follow up, larger populations and a wider demographic range is recommended. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Many changes have been initiated in the Dutch hospital sector to optimize health-care delivery: national agenda-setting, increased competition and transparency, a new system of hospital reimbursement based on diagnosis-treatment combinations, intensified monitoring of quality and a multi-layered organizational development programme based on quality improvement collaboratives. The objective is to answer the question as to whether these changes were accompanied by a further development of hospital quality management systems and to what extent did the development within the multi-layered programme hospitals differ from that in other hospitals. {DESIGN}: Longitudinal data were collected in 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2007 using a validated questionnaire. Descriptive analyses and multi-level modelling were applied to test whether: (1) quality management system development stages in hospitals differ over time, (2) development stages and trends differ between hospitals participating or not participating in the multi-layered programme and (3) hospital size has an effect on development stage. {SETTING}: Dutch hospital sector between 1995 and 2007. {PARTICIPANTS}: Hospital organizations. {INTERVENTION}: Changes through time. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURE}: Quality management system development stage. {RESULTS}: Since 1995, hospital quality management systems have reached higher development levels. Programme participants have developed their quality management system more rapidly than have non-participants. However, this effect is confounded by hospital size. {CONCLUSIONS}: Study results suggest that the combination of policy measures at macro level was accompanied by an increase in hospital size and the further development of quality management systems. Hospitals are entering the stage of systematic quality improvement.},

	abstract = {Previous research indicates that long-term meditation practice is associated with altered resting electroencephalogram patterns, suggestive of long lasting changes in brain activity. We hypothesized that meditation practice might also be associated with changes in the brain's physical structure. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess cortical thickness in 20 participants with extensive Insight meditation experience, which involves focused attention to internal experiences. Brain regions associated with attention, interoception and sensory processing were thicker in meditation participants than matched controls, including the prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula. Between-group differences in prefrontal cortical thickness were most pronounced in older participants, suggesting that meditation might offset age-related cortical thinning. Finally, the thickness of two regions correlated with meditation experience. These data provide the first structural evidence for experience-dependent cortical plasticity associated with meditation practice.},

	abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma ({HCC}) is one of the most common and aggressive human malignancies. Its high mortality rate is mainly a result of intra-hepatic metastases. We analyzed the expression profiles of {HCC} samples without or with intra-hepatic metastases. Using a supervised machine-learning algorithm, we generated for the first time a molecular signature that can classify metastatic {HCC} patients and identified genes that were relevant to metastasis and patient survival. We found that the gene expression signature of primary {HCCs} with accompanying metastasis was very similar to that of their corresponding metastases, implying that genes favoring metastasis progression were initiated in the primary tumors. Osteopontin, which was identified as a lead gene in the signature, was over-expressed in metastatic {HCC}; an osteopontin-specific antibody effectively blocked {HCC} cell invasion in vitro and inhibited pulmonary metastasis of {HCC} cells in nude mice. Thus, osteopontin acts as both a diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for metastatic {HCC}.},

Have these calls for change had an impact on the statistical reporting practices in conservation biology? In 2000 and 2001, 92\% of sampled articles in Conservation Biology and Biological Conservation reported results of null-hypothesis tests. In 2005 this figure dropped to 78\%. There were corresponding increases in the use of confidence intervals, information theoretic, and Bayesian techniques. Of those articles reporting null-hypothesis testing--which still easily constitute the majority--very few report statistical power (8\%) and many misinterpret statistical nonsignificance as evidence for no effect (63\%). Overall, results of our survey show some improvements in statistical practice, but further efforts are clearly required to move the discipline toward improved practices.},

Reporting on past conscious experience is inherently tricky and presents unique challenges to the assessment of mindfulness. Mindfulness-present and mindfulness-absent items may represent different aspects of the construct to different populations resulting from differential skill in assessing sustained or lapsed conscious attention. The current study shows that an online sample of meditators and non-meditators with similar overall levels of mindfulness differentially endorse response options for positively and negatively worded items. While meditators endorse mindfulness-present and mindfulness-absent items with nearly equivalent frequency, student non-meditators are much more likely to reject mindfulness-absent items than to accept mindfulness-present items. The differential item functioning between these two groups represents a potential problem regarding construct validity when comparing meditators to non-meditators and when assessing mindfulness as a pre-post measure with meditation practice.},

Specifically, bullet graphs support the comparison of the featured measure to one or more related measures (for example, a target or the same measure at some point in the past, such as a year ago) and relate the featured measure to defined quantitative ranges that declare its qualitative state (for example, good, satisfactory, and poor).

	abstract = {Impulsivity is generally held to be an important dimension of personality. It has been conceptualized in many different ways: as a cognitive style termed impulsivity/reflection, as a subtrait of extraversion or psychoticism, and as a trait of its own. The present study focused on the relation between some of these different impulsivity aspects and response latencies to questionnaires. The Matching Familiar Figures Test ({MFFT}), the Eysenck Personality Inventory ({EPI}), a self-report impulsivity questionnaire, and the Self-Consciousness Scale ({SCS}) were administered to 65 Austrian undergraduate students. By means of a computerized presentation, questionnaire response latencies were recorded. Virtually no relationship was found between {MFFT}, self-report impulsivity, and response latencies. In addition to previous studies, the present results, therefore, cast doubt on a broad impulsivity concept. Secondary findings of this study are pertinent to the relation between impulsivity and anxiety, to the orthogonality of impulsivity and self-consciousness, and to sex differences in impulsivity.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: As computational power improves, the application of more advanced machine learning techniques to the analysis of large genome-wide association ({GWA}) datasets becomes possible. While most traditional statistical methods can only elucidate main effects of genetic variants on risk for disease, certain machine learning approaches are particularly suited to discover higher order and non-linear effects. One such approach is the Random Forests ({RF}) algorithm. The use of {RF} for {SNP} discovery related to human disease has grown in recent years; however, most work has focused on small datasets or simulation studies which are limited.

{RESULTS}: Using a multiple sclerosis ({MS}) case-control dataset comprised of 300 K {SNP} genotypes across the genome, we outline an approach and some considerations for optimally tuning the {RF} algorithm based on the empirical dataset. Importantly, results show that typical default parameter values are not appropriate for large {GWA} datasets. Furthermore, gains can be made by sub-sampling the data, pruning based on linkage disequilibrium ({LD}), and removing strong effects from {RF} analyses. The new {RF} results are compared to findings from the original {MS} {GWA} study and demonstrate overlap. In addition, four new interesting candidate {MS} genes are identified, {MPHOSPH}9, {CTNNA}3, {PHACTR}2 and {IL}7, by {RF} analysis and warrant further follow-up in independent studies.

{CONCLUSIONS}: This study presents one of the first illustrations of successfully analyzing {GWA} data with a machine learning algorithm. It is shown that {RF} is computationally feasible for {GWA} data and the results obtained make biologic sense based on previous studies. More importantly, new genes were identified as potentially being associated with {MS}, suggesting new avenues of investigation for this complex disease.},

Healthy adults performed a temporal bisection task in which they had to categorize the presentation duration of pictures (neutral, liked, and disliked foods) as more similar to a short (400 ms) or to a long (1,600 ms) standard duration. The data revealed that the presentation duration of food pictures was underestimated compared with the presentation duration of the neutral picture, and that this underestimation was more marked for the disliked than for the liked food pictures. These results are consistent with the idea that this time underestimation arises from an attentional-bias mechanism. The food pictures, and particularly those depicting disliked food items, distracted attention away from the processing of time.},

Although support has been found for the psychometric properties of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales ({DASS}) using classical test theory approaches it has not been subjected to Rasch analysis. The aim of this study was to use Rasch analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the {DASS}-21 scales, using two different administration modes.{METHODS}:The {DASS}-21 was administered to 420 participants with half the sample responding to a web-based version and the other half completing a traditional pencil-and-paper version. Conformity of {DASS}-21 scales to a Rasch partial credit model was assessed using the {RUMM}2020 software.{RESULTS}:To achieve adequate model fit it was necessary to remove one item from each of the {DASS}-21 subscales. The reduced scales showed adequate internal consistency reliability, unidimensionality and freedom from differential item functioning for sex, age and mode of administration. Analysis of all {DASS}-21 items combined did not support its use as a measure of general psychological distress. A scale combining the anxiety and stress items showed satisfactory fit to the Rasch model after removal of three items.{CONCLUSION}:The results provide support for the measurement properties, internal consistency reliability, and unidimensionality of three slightly modified {DASS}-21 scales, across two different administration methods. The further use of Rasch analysis on the {DASS}-21 in larger and broader samples is recommended to confirm the findings of the current study.},

	abstract = {This experiment examined the effects on pupil size of the relevance of an overt response to a cognitive task. Sixteen Ss were assigned to two experimental groups. In one group Ss were required to judge the pitch equality of tones and, subsequently, indicate their decision by pressing or not pressing a telegraph key. In the other group Ss were required to make the pitch-discriminations, but the key press response was unrelated to the preceding cognitive task. Continuous photographs of each S's pupil were taken during the experiment. Results showed that a small amount of pupillary dilation occurred during the discrimination task in the group where the key press was irrelevant to the pitch-discrimination. In the group where S's behavior indicated task fulfillment, however, a significantly greater increase in pupil size occurred, the amount of dilation being larger when task completion was indicated by the key press response than when fulfillment was indicated by no key press. The findings were discussed in terms of arousal associated with apprehension about evaluation, and muscle tension from anticipation of making the overt response. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]; Copyright of Psychophysiology is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Factor analysis identified 3 separate dimensions of satisfaction, which pertained to the visit itself, to access and to general attitude toward the {ECO}. Validation tests were consistent with expectations. In multivariate analysis, older patient age and greater perceived treatment effectiveness predicted independently all satisfaction scales. Presence of a mixed physical and mental problem reduced satisfaction with the visit itself only, a delay between the phone call and the visit exceeding one hour reduced satisfaction with access and worsened the attitude toward the {ECO}.; Conclusion: The instrument used to measure patient satisfaction with emergency house calls performed well. Overall levels of satisfaction were high. Perceived effectiveness of treatment was the strongest correlate of patient satisfaction.

These principles and caveats rest on my sense of three parallel evolutions: the convergence of trends in the roles of mathematics, computation, and context within statistics education. These ongoing changes, together with the articles cited above and the seminal provocation by Leo Breiman (2001) call for a deep rethinking of what we teach to undergraduates.

Diener's (1984) review placed greater emphasis on theories that stressed psychological factors. In the current article, the authors review current evidence for Wilson's conclusions and discuss modern theories of {SWB} that stress dispositional influences, adaptation, goals, and coping strategies. The next steps in the evolution of the field are to comprehend the interaction of psychological factors with life circumstances in producing {SWB}, to understand the causal pathways leading to happiness, understand the processes underlying adaptation to events, and develop theories that explain why certain variables differentially influence the different components of {SWB} (life satisfaction, pleasant affect, and unpleasant affect).

	abstract = {In this paper we present the R package {deSolve} to solve initial value problems ({IVP}) written as ordinary differential equations ({ODE}), differential algebraic equations ({DAE}) of index 0 or 1 and partial differential equations ({PDE}), the latter solved using the method of lines approach. The differential equations can be represented in R code or as compiled code. In the latter case, R is used as a tool to trigger the integration and post-process the results, which facilitates model development and application, whilst the compiled code significantly increases simulation speed. The methods implemented are efficient, robust, and well documented public-domain Fortran routines. They include four integrators from the {ODEPACK} package ({LSODE}, {LSODES}, {LSODA}, {LSODAR}), {DVODE} and {DASPK}2.0. In addition, a suite of Runge-Kutta integrators and special-purpose solvers to efficiently integrate 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional partial differential equations are available. The routines solve both stiff and non-stiff systems, and include many options, e. g., to deal in an efficient way with the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, or finding the root of equations. In this article, our objectives are threefold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of using R for dynamic modeling, (2) to highlight typical uses of the different methods implemented and (3) to compare the performance of models specified in R code and in compiled code for a number of test cases. These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the bene fits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R's high-level procedures. {deSolve} is the successor of packageo desolve which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the {GNU} General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

If so, they should vary strategically with manipulations of mating-related motives. The authors examined this possibility in 4 experiments. Inducing mating goals in men increased their willingness to spend on conspicuous luxuries but not on basic necessities. In women, mating goals boosted public--but not private--helping. Although mating motivation did not generally inspire helping in men, it did induce more helpfulness in contexts in which they could display heroism or dominance. Conversely, although mating motivation did not lead women to conspicuously consume, it did lead women to spend more publicly on helpful causes. Overall, romantic motives seem to produce highly strategic and sex-specific self-presentations best understood within a costly signaling framework.},

	abstract = {Purpose -- This research sets about discovering if it is possible to identify distinct, practice-relevant and addressable clusters by means of selected criteria for constructing typologies -- such as psychographic, culturally-specific and purchasing behaviour-relevant features -- which permit an online supplier to efficiently and effectively focus on attractive consumer segments. Design/methodology/approach -- To answer the research question, the study conducted an online survey with 1,011 participants. The respondents were from three countries, each with culturally-distinct features: France, Germany and the {US}. Underpinning the research are theoretically-secured constructs of purchasing behaviour on the internet. Findings -- Cluster analysis confirmed the outstanding validity of a three-cluster-solution (97.7 per cent score) -- risk-averse doubters, open-minded online shoppers, and reserved information-seekers. Discriminant analysis shows that certain constructs, particularly “neuroticism”, “willingness to buy” and “shopping pleasure”, separate the clusters best. Research limitations/implications -- An extension of our clustering approach to more countries and especially non-western cultures promises interesting results. Furthermore, researchers are encouraged to enlarge the catalogue of clustering variables to allow an even more specific fine-tuning of the main clusters identified in this research. Practical implications -- The classification created provides the potential for a much closer fit between a company's goods and services and heterogeneous customer needs. Originality/value -- The principal contribution of the paper is the identification of three different clusters of internet users. This can be of good use for shaping internet marketing, particularly by virtue of the likely stability over time from cultural and personality characteristics.},

	abstract = {Traditional accounts of verbal short-term memory explain differences in performance for different types of verbal material by reference to inherent characteristics of the verbal items making up memory sequences. The role of previous experience with sequences of different types is ostensibly controlled for either by deliberate exclusion or by presenting multiple trials constructed from different random permutations. We cast doubt on this general approach in a detailed analysis of the basis for the robust finding that short-term memory for digit sequences is superior to that for other sequences of verbal material. Specifically, we show across four experiments that this advantage is not due to inherent characteristics of digits as verbal items, nor are individual digits within sequences better remembered than other types of individual verbal items. Rather, the advantage for digit sequences stems from the increased frequency, compared to other verbal material, with which digits appear in random sequences in natural language, and furthermore, relatively frequent digit sequences support better short-term serial recall than less frequent ones. We also provide corpus-based computational support for the argument that performance in a short-term memory setting is a function of basic associative learning processes operating on the linguistic experience of the rememberer. The experimental and computational results raise questions not only about the role played by measurement of digit span in cognition generally, but also about the way in which long-term memory processes impact on short-term memory functioning.},

	abstract = {Fluid intelligence (Gf) refers to the ability to reason and to solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge. Gf is critical for a wide variety of cognitive tasks, and it is considered one of the most important factors in learning. Moreover, Gf is closely related to professional and educational success, especially in complex and demanding environments. Although performance on tests of Gf can be improved through direct practice on the tests themselves, there is no evidence that training on any other regimen yields increased Gf in adults. Furthermore, there is a long history of research into cognitive training showing that, although performance on trained tasks can increase dramatically, transfer of this learning to other tasks remains poor. Here, we present evidence for transfer from training on a demanding working memory task to measures of Gf. This transfer results even though the trained task is entirely different from the intelligence test itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extent of gain in intelligence critically depends on the amount of training: the more training, the more improvement in Gf. That is, the training effect is dosage-dependent. Thus, in contrast to many previous studies, we conclude that it is possible to improve Gf without practicing the testing tasks themselves, opening a wide range of applications.},

New challenges await psychologists in light of the resulting "Big Data" sets, because classic psychological methods will only in part be able to analyze this data derived from ubiquitous mobile devices, as well as other everyday technologies. As a consequence, psychologists must enrich their scientific methods through the inclusion of methods from informatics. The paper provides a brief review of one area of this research field, dealing mainly with social networks and smartphones. Moreover, we highlight how data derived from Psychoinformatics can be combined in a meaningful way with data from human neuroscience.

We selected potential predictor variables from the characteristics of the doctors and of their patient and colleague assessors.{RESULTS}: After we adjusted for characteristics of the doctor as well as characteristics of the patient sample, less favourable scores from patient feedback were independently predicted by doctors having obtained their primary medical degree from any non-European country; doctors practising as a psychiatrist; lower proportions of white patients providing feedback; lower proportions of patients rating their consultation as being very important; and lower proportions of patients reporting that they were seeing their usual doctor. Lower scores from colleague feedback were independently predicted by doctors having obtained their primary medical degree from countries outside the {UK} and South Asia; currently employed in a locum capacity; working as a general practitioner or psychiatrist; being employed in a staff grade, associate specialist, or other equivalent role; and with a lower proportion of colleagues reporting they had daily or weekly professional contact with the doctor. In fully adjusted models, the doctor's age, sex, and ethnic group were not independent predictors of patient or colleague feedback. Neither the age or sex profiles of the patient or colleague samples were independent predictors of doctors' feedback scores, and nor was the ethnic group of colleague samples. {CONCLUSIONS}: Caution is necessary when considering patient and colleague feedback regarding doctors' professionalism. Multisource feedback undertaken for revalidation using the {GMC} patient and colleague questionnaires should, at least initially, be principally formative in nature.},

To examine the feasibility, reliability and validity of a 20-item scale for measuring perceived quality of maternity services provided at commune health centres in rural Vietnam. Design. A survey of 200 women who gave birth in July-August 2000 and 196 pregnant women in 34 communes in Quang Xuong District, Thanh Hoa Province, Vietnam. Main outcome measures. Inter-rater reliability, internal consistency and factor structure of the scale were examined. The associations between perceived quality and client characteristics were also investigated. Results. The instrument had relatively good inter-rater reliability and internal consistency. Except for two items: 'good clinical examination' and 'adequacy of health workers for women's health', the scale exhibited good agreement between the two raters, with kappa values ranging from 0.54 to 0.84. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the dimensions 'health care delivery', 'health facility', 'interpersonal aspects of care' and 'access to services' were 0.72, 0.64, 0.72 and 0.33, respectively. Respondents were positive on items related to the dimensions 'interpersonal aspects of care' and 'access to services', but negative on the dimensions 'health care delivery' and 'health facility'.

Validated cutoff scores on the {GBI} were used to identify individuals at risk for a mood disorder. It was hypothesized that, among at-risk respondents, high {BAS} and low {BIS} levels would be associated with high current mania ratings, whereas low {BAS} and high {BIS} would be associated with high current depression ratings. Multiple regression analyses indicated that, among at-risk individuals (n = 63), {BAS} accounted for 27\% of current mania symptoms but {BIS} did not contribute.

	abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the current knowledge of the neurophysiology and cellular pharmacology of sleep mechanisms. It is written from the perspective that recent years have seen a remarkable development of knowledge about sleep mechanisms, due to the capability of current cellular neurophysiological, pharmacological and molecular techniques to provide focused, detailed, and replicable studies that have enriched and informed the knowledge of sleep phenomenology and pathology derived from electroencephalographic ({EEG}) analysis. This chapter has a cellular and neurophysiological/neuropharmacological focus, with an emphasis on rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep mechanisms and non-{REM} ({NREM}) sleep phenomena attributable to adenosine. The survey of neuronal and neurotransmitter-related brainstem mechanisms of {REM} includes monoamines, acetylcholine, the reticular formation, a new emphasis on {GABAergic} mechanisms and a discussion of the role of orexin/hypcretin in diurnal consolidation of {REM} sleep. The focus of the {NREM} sleep discussion is on the basal forebrain and adenosine as a mediator of homeostatic control. Control is through basal forebrain extracellular adenosine accumulation during wakefulness and inhibition of wakefulness-active neurons. Over longer periods of sleep loss, there is a second mechanism of homeostatic control through transcriptional modification. Adenosine acting at the A1 receptor produces an up-regulation of A1 receptors, which increases inhibition for a given level of adenosine, effectively increasing the gain of the sleep homeostat. This second mechanism likely occurs in widespread cortical areas as well as in the basal forebrain. Finally, the results of a new series of experimental paradigms in rodents to measure the neurocognitive effects of sleep loss and sleep interruption (modeling sleep apnea) provide animal model data congruent with those in humans.},

A sample of 278 undergraduate college students completed self-report measures of depressive affect, negative cognitions, and mindfulness-based attention. As expected, depressive affect was positively related to negative cognitions, mindfulness-based attention was inversely related to negative cognitions, and the strength of the relationship between depressed affect and negative cognitions was significantly moderated by mindfulness-based attention. More specifically, a simple slope analysis revealed that individuals low in mindfulness-based attention evidenced a statistically significant relationship between depressive affect and negative cognitions, whereas individuals who are high in mindfulness-based attention did not. These findings support the extant literature suggesting that the general tendency to be mindful may be a protective factor against the development of psychopathology and enhance mental health.

	abstract = {Background: Reproducibility is the hallmark of good science. Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow. Findings: Version control systems ({VCS}), which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source {VCS}, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.},

	abstract = {The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ({MAAS}) is one of the most popular measures of mindfulness, exhibiting promising psychometric properties and theoretically consistent relationships to brain activity, mindfulness-based intervention ({MBI}) outcomes, and mediation of {MBI} effects. The present study investigated the response patterns and scale properties in a large sample of undergraduate students (N= 414) using Item Response Theory analyses. The findings suggest that general statements of " automatic inattentiveness" or " automatic pilot" confer greater statistical information about the underlying latent trait. Evidence of limited abilities to report on mindlessness and of response bias to " mindfulness-absent" items suggests challenges to the construct validity of the {MAAS}. The current findings, along with pre-existing data, suggest that reverse-scoring the scale may be inadequate to represent intentional attention or awareness. Further research is needed to determine which variations, components, and correlates of the numerous operationalizations of mindfulness are theoretically consistent and most salient to positive outcomes, especially in psychopathology. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17672382},
	abstract = {Mindfulness is defined as paying attention in the present moment. We investigate the hypothesis that mindfulness training may alter or enhance specific aspects of attention. We examined three functionally and neuroanatomically distinct but overlapping attentional subsystems: alerting, orienting, and conflict monitoring. Functioning of each subsystem was indexed by performance on the Attention Network Test. Two types of mindfulness training ({MT}) programs were examined, and behavioral testing was conducted on participants before (Time 1) and after (Time 2) training. One training group consisted of individuals naive to mindfulness techniques who participated in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction ({MBSR}) course that emphasized the development of concentrative meditation skills. The other training group consisted of individuals experienced in concentrative meditation techniques who participated in a 1-month intensive mindfulness retreat. Performance of these groups was compared with that of control participants who were meditation naive and received no {MT}. At Time 1, the participants in the retreat group demonstrated improved conflict monitoring performance relative to those in the {MBSR} and control groups. At Time 2, the participants in the {MBSR} course demonstrated significantly improved orienting in comparison with the control and retreat participants. In contrast, the participants in the retreat group demonstrated altered performance on the alerting component, with improvements in exogenous stimulus detection in comparison with the control and {MBSR} participants. The groups did not differ in conflict monitoring performance at Time 2. These results suggest that mindfulness training may improve attention-related behavioral responses by enhancing functioning of specific subcomponents of attention. Whereas participation in the {MBSR} course improved the ability to endogenously orient attention, retreat participation appeared to allow for the development and emergence of receptive attentional skills, which improved exogenous alerting-related process.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: To summarize the development and application of a generic measure of health-related quality of life known as the Quality of Well-Being Scale ({QWB}). {BACKGROUND}: The {QWB} is part of a general health policy model. The measure includes functional components for mobility, physical activity, and social activity. In addition, it includes a comprehensive list of symptoms and problems. {QWB} scoring allows placement of each individual on a continuum of wellness ranging from 0 (for dead) to 1.0 for asymptomatic full function. The General Health Policy Model combines this point in time measure with information on prognosis and mortality to estimate quality-adjusted life-years ({QALYs}). Forming a ratio of program costs to {QALYs} yields estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life year. Evidence supports the validity of the {QWB} for a wide variety of applications in population monitoring, descriptive studies of patient populations, and clinical trials. We offer a variety of comparisons between the {QWB} and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 ({SF}-36). {MAIN} {FINDINGS}: In comparison with the {SF}-36, the {QWB} provides less information on health profiles, but has the advantage of providing a metric that can be used for cost-utility or cost-effectiveness analysis. Although ceiling effects are common for some {SF}-36 subscales, perfect scores on the {QWB} are very rare. The {QWB} has an approximately normal distribution for populations of adults. Although, often criticized for not including a mental health component, we present evidence documenting the validity of the {QWB} for patients with psychological and psychiatric diagnoses. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {QWB} and {SF}-36 are alternative comprehensive measures of health outcomes.},

	issn = {1616-3443},
	abstract = {Einsatzbereich: Ab 14 Jahre. Einsatz im klinischen Bereich und in der epidemiologischen Forschung. Das Verfahren: Der {SF}-36 ist ein krankheitsübergreifendes Messinstrument zur Erfassung der gesundheitsbezogenen Lebensqualität von Patienten, welcher aus 36 Items besteht. Er erfasst acht Dimensionen der subjektiven Gesundheit: Körperliche Funktionsfähigkeit, Körperliche Rollenfunktion, Körperliche Schmerzen, Allgemeine Gesundheitswahrnehmung, Vitalität, Soziale Funktionsfähigkeit, Emotionale Rollenfunktion und Psychisches Wohlbefinden, die sich den Grunddimensionen Körperliche und Psychische Gesundheit zuordnen lassen. Mit einem Einzelitem wird zusätzlich der aktuelle Gesundheitszustand im Vergleich zum vergangenen Jahr erfragt. Mit dem {SF}-12 steht eine ökonomische Kurzform zur Verfügung. Sowohl {SF}-36 als auch {SF}-12 liegen in jeweils sechs Versionen vor: Die Akutversion bezieht sich auf die vergangene Woche und die Standardversion auf die vergangenen vier Wochen. Beide Versionen können als Fragebogen oder als Interview durchgeführt werden, wobei jeweils zwischen Selbstbeurteilung und Fremdbeurteilung gewählt werden kann. Dem Manual liegt eine {CD}-{ROM} bei. Diese enthält die Rohdaten der deutschen Normstichprobe aus dem Jahre 1994 sowie Eingabe- und Syntaxdateien für die Auswertung mit {SPSS} oder {SAS}, für deren Benutzung auf dem Computer {SPSS} oder {SAS} installiert sein muss. Für die 2., ergänzte und überarbeitete Auflage des {SF}-36 wurden die Normwerte vollständig neu berechnet. Dabei wurde auf eine entsprechende Alters- und Regionalgewichtung Rücksicht genommen. In allen Normtabellen wurden die Werte der beiden Summenskalen neu integriert. Es wurden zusätzliche, ausführliche Hinweise für die Auswertung in das Manual aufgenommen. Erstmalig ist die Auswertung per Hand mit einem Auswertungsbogen möglich. Zuverlässigkeit: Die internen Konsistenzen (Cronbachs Alpha) der Subskalen liegen in verschiedenen Stichproben mehrheitlich deutlich über .70. Einzig die Subskalen Allgemeine Gesundheitswahrnehmung und Soziale Funktionsfähigkeit lagen in einigen Stichproben zwischen α = .57 und α = .69. Gültigkeit: Es werden umfangreiche Studien zur konvergenten, diskriminanten Validität und Sensitivität des Verfahrens angeführt. Normen: Es liegen Normdaten für Deutschland aus der repräsentativen Bevölkerungsstichprobe von 1994 (N = 2.914), aus dem Bundesgesundheitssurvey von 1998 (N = 6.967) sowie nur für den {SF}-12 für Österreich aus der Steirischen Gesundheitsbefragung von 1999 (N = 5.169) vor. Weiterhin stehen umfangreiche Vergleichsdaten für verschiedene Patientengruppen zur Verfügung. Bearbeitungsdauer: Etwa 10 Minuten für den Gesamtfragebogen {SF}-36 und 2 Minuten für die Kurzform {SF}-12. In 2., ergänzter und überarbeiteter Auflage seit 2011 lieferbar.},

However, it is not known which type of pacemaker results in superior clinical and patient outcomes. To date, there is no feasible and validated disease-specific questionnaire for pacemaker patients to assess quality of life ({QoL}) available. The Aquarel questionnaire was developed as a disease-specific extension to the Short-Form-36 ({SF}-36). A cross-sectional study was carried out in 74 pacemaker patients to evaluate validity and reliability of this instrument. Items were selected and scales constructed based on factorial analysis. Internal consistency, content validity and test-retest reliability were moderate to excellent. Correlations with the {SF}-36 scales, pacing mode and functional tests were as hypothesized, demonstrating the individual value and distinctiveness of the Aquarel subscales. The results support the feasibility and usefulness of evaluating {QoL} in pacemaker patients when using Aquarel as an extension to the {SF}-36.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: No published quantitative instrument exists to measure maternal satisfaction with the quality of different models of labour care in the {UK}. {METHODS}: A quantitative psychometric multidimensional maternal satisfaction questionnaire, the Women's Views of Birth Labour Satisfaction Questionnaire ({WOMBLSQ}), was developed using principal components analysis with varimax rotation of successive versions. Internal reliability and content and construct validity were assessed. {RESULTS}: Of 300 women sent the first version ({WOMBLSQ}1), 120 (40\%) replied; of 300 sent {WOMBLSQ}2, 188 (62.7\%) replied; of 500 women sent {WOMBLSQ}3, 319 (63.8\%) replied; and of 2400 women sent {WOMBLSQ}4, 1683 (70.1\%) replied. The latter two versions consisted of 10 dimensions in addition to general satisfaction. These were (Cronbach's alpha): professional support in labour (0.91), expectations of labour (0.90), home assessment in early labour (0.90), holding the baby (0.87), support from husband/partner (0.83), pain relief in labour (0.83), pain relief immediately after labour (0.65), knowing labour carers (0.82), labour environment (0.80), and control in labour (0.62). There were moderate correlations (range 0.16-0.73) between individual dimensions and the general satisfaction scale (0.75). Scores on individual dimensions were significantly related to a range of clinical and demographic variables. {CONCLUSION}: This multidimensional labour satisfaction instrument has good validity and internal reliability. It could be used to assess care in labour across different models of maternity care, or as a prelude to in depth exploration of specific areas of concern. Its external reliability and transferability to care outside the South West region needs further evaluation, particularly in terms of ethnicity and social class.},

This definition has evolved from the concept of a unitary short-term memory system. Working memory has been found to require the simultaneous storage and processing of information. It can be divided into the following three subcomponents: (i) the central executive, which is assumed to be an attentional-controlling system, is important in skills such as chess playing and is particularly susceptible to the effects of Alzheimer's disease; and two slave systems, namely (ii) the visuospatial sketch pad, which manipulates visual images and (iii) the phonological loop, which stores and rehearses speech-based information and is necessary for the acquisition of both native and second-language vocabulary.},

	abstract = {The unprecedented popularity of the social networking site Facebook raises a number of important questions regarding the impact it has on sociality. However, as Facebook is a very recent social phenomenon, there is a distinct lack of psychological theory relating to its use. While research has begun to identify the types of people who use Facebook, this line of investigation has been limited to student populations. The current study aimed to investigate how personality influences usage or non-usage of Facebook. The sample consisted of 1324 self-selected Australian Internet users (1158 Facebook users and 166 Facebook nonusers), between the ages of 18 and 44. Participants were required to complete an online questionnaire package comprising the Big Five Inventory ({BFI}), the Narcissistic Personality Inventory - 29-item version ({NPI}-29), the Revised Cheek and Buss Shyness Scale ({RCBS}), and the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults - Short version ({SELSA}-S). Facebook users also completed a Facebook usage questionnaire. The results showed that Facebook users tend to be more extraverted and narcissistic, but less conscientious and socially lonely, than nonusers. Furthermore, frequency of Facebook use and preferences for specific features were also shown to vary as a result of certain characteristics, such as neuroticism, loneliness, shyness and narcissism. It is hoped that research in this area continues, and leads to the development of theory regarding the implications and gratifications of Facebook use. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For the sake of conciseness, detailed description of statistical methods is omitted. {RESULTS}: Widely accepted principles for critically appraising scientific articles are outlined. Basic knowledge of study design, structuring of an article, the role of different sections, of statistical presentations as well as sources of error and limitation are presented. The reader does not require extensive methodological knowledge. As far as necessary for critical appraisal of scientific articles, differences in research areas like epidemiology, clinical, and basic research are outlined. Further useful references are presented. {CONCLUSION}: Basic methodological knowledge is required to select and interpret scientific articles correctly.},

Data collection followed the standardized and validated Picker Institute methodology for a period of 13 weeks in the fall/winter of 2005. {PARTICIPANTS}: Inpatients age 18 years and older (n = 14 089), discharged within the sampling period. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: 'Patient experience', measured by the total Picker Problem Score ({PPS}) and by six domain scores (care, communication, respect, cooperation, organization, discharge management). {RESULTS}: In regression analysis, the patient factors self-reported health, age and education explained the highest proportion of variability in the {PPS} (4.8, 2.2 and 0.7 per cent, respectively). Multiple linear adjustment for factors associated with patients removed between 29 and 33 per cent of variability between hospital categories. The domain score means varied from under 5 per cent for 'respect towards the patient' to 34 per cent for 'discharge management'. Ranking of hospitals by domain scores differed from the ranking based on the total {PPS}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Statistical adjustment for patient mix and additional stratification for some hospital factors make benchmarking using patient survey data fairer and more transparent. Use of our approach for presenting quality data may make interpretation easier for the different target groups and may enhance the relevance of such information for decision-making. [Abstract]},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the role of the health care professional in creating an optimal healing environment ({OHE}), with a special focus on which inner state and way of being in the world can create a healing intention. A core thesis is that every healing effort and every healing intention starts within the health care professional. An accepting, mindful, and warm-hearted relationship with self is primary to any healing intention. Important concepts to develop such an attitude are mindfulness, love, compassion, and awareness. The concept of a healing attitude toward the self is described, as is the mirror principle that states there is symmetry between someone's relationship with the outer world and his or her inner world. The mindfulness concept is outlined through a set of mental and heart qualities. Mindfulness is strongly related to compassion, and it is compassion that serves as a source for all healing intentionality. Compassion connects the suffering of the patient with the healer's own suffering, and this emotional connection instantiates a healing relationship. The power and importance of mindfulness and compassion for healing are explored along the Frank model of nonspecific therapeutic components. This is the approach whereby a health care professional can elicit self-healing powers in patients through his or her inner attitudes. Finally, a research program and some hypotheses on how to implement and research this specific approach toward the creation of an {OHE} are outlined.},

Tests enhance later retention more than additional study of the material, even when tests are given without feedback. This surpris- ing phenomenon is called the testing effect, and although it has been studied by cognitive psychologists sporadically over the years, today there is a renewed effort to learn why testing is effective and to apply testing in educational settings. In this article, we selectively review laboratory studies that reveal the power of testing in improving re- tention and then turn to studies that demonstrate the basic effects in educational settings. We also consider the related concepts of dynamic testing and formative assess- ment as other means of using tests to improve learning. Finally,we consider some negative consequences of testing that may occur in certain circumstances, though these negative effects are often small and do not cancel out the large positive effects of testing. Frequent testing in the classroom may boost educational achievement at all levels of education.},

Results revealed an effect of emotion on temporal judgment, with emotional stimuli judged to be longer than neutral ones for a similar arousal level. Within scalar expectancy theory (J. Gibbon, R. Church, \& W. Meck, 1984), this suggests that emotion-induced activation generates an increase in pacemaker rate, leading to a longer perceived duration. A further exploration of self-assessed emotional dimensions showed an effect of valence and arousal. Negative sounds were judged to be longer than positive ones, indicating that negative stimuli generate a greater increase of activation. High-arousing stimuli were perceived to be shorter than low-arousing ones. Consistent with attentional models of timing, this seems to reflect a decrease of attention devoted to time, leading to a shorter perceived duration. These effects, robust across the 2 tasks, are limited to short intervals and overall suggest that both activation and attentional processes modulate the timing of emotional events.},

This tutorial begins with a series of graphical horror stories from the scientific and lay press. Then elements of graphical perception and good graph construction, many from the writings of Bill Cleveland, are covered. Practical suggestions for choosing the best chart or graph type, making good and clear graphics, and formatting are covered. Techniques for simultaneous presentation of multiple variables are described. Examples of model presentation graphics will also be given. The second part of the tutorial consists of interactive demonstrations of how to make effective statistical graphics using the freely available R environment for data analysis and graphics (www.R-project.org). This will focus on base, lattice and ggplot2 graphics as well as graphics functions in the presenter's Hmisc package. At the close of the workshop some graphical marvels from the literature (especially from Edward Tufte and Howard Wainer) are presented.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present the R package {deSolve} to solve initial value problems ({IVP}) written as ordinary differential equations ({ODE}), differential algebraic equations ({DAE}) of index 0 or 1 and partial differential equations ({PDE}), the latter solved using the method of lines approach. The differential equations can be represented in R code or as compiled code. In the latter case, R is used as a tool to trigger the integration and post-process the results, which facilitates model development and application, whilst the compiled code significantly increases simulation speed. The methods implemented are efficient, robust, and well documented public-domain Fortran routines. They include four integrators from the {ODEPACK} package ({LSODE}, {LSODES}, {LSODA}, {LSODAR}), {DVODE} and {DASPK}2.0. In addition, a suite of Runge-Kutta integrators and special-purpose solvers to efficiently integrate 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional partial differential equations are available. The routines solve both stiff and non-stiff systems, and include many options, e. g., to deal in an efficient way with the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, or finding the root of equations. In this article, our objectives are threefold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of using R for dynamic modeling, (2) to highlight typical uses of the different methods implemented and (3) to compare the performance of models specified in R code and in compiled code for a number of test cases. These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the bene fits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R's high-level procedures. {deSolve} is the successor of packageo desolve which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the {GNU} General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

Emotions are organized biphasically, as appetitive or aversive (defensive). Reflexes with the same valence as an ongoing emotional state are augmented; mismatched reflexes are inhibited. Thus, the startle response (an aversive reflex) is enhanced during a fear state and is diminished in a pleasant emotional context. This affect-startle effect is not determined by general arousal, simple attention, or probe modality. The effect is found when affects are prompted by pictures or memory images, changes appropriately with aversive conditioning, and may be dependent on right-hemisphere processing.

The aim was to psychometrically test the Urgent Care System Questionnaire ({UCSQ}) for the routine measurement of the patient perspective of the emergency and urgent care system. {METHODS}: The {UCSQ} was developed based on qualitative research with recent users of the system. It consisted of a screening question to identify recent users and questions on the patient experience of, and satisfaction with, their most recent event. The acceptability, validity and reliability of the {UCSQ} were tested in a postal survey of 900 members of the general population and a telephone survey of a quota sample of 1000 members of the general population. {RESULTS}: The response rate to the postal survey was 51\% (457/893). In the telephone survey, 11604 calls were made to obtain a quota sample of 1014 people. These surveys identified 250 system users in the previous 3 months. A principal-components analysis identified three satisfaction components with good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha between 0.7 and 0.93): 'progress through the system' (10 items), 'entry into the system' (three items) and 'patient convenience' (five items). These components varied as expected by age and overall rating of the system. {CONCLUSION}: Preliminary testing suggests that the {UCSQ} has reasonable acceptability, validity and reliability. Further testing is required, particularly its responsiveness to changes in emergency and urgent care systems.},

This paper explores the underlying mechanisms of this finding. We measured the physiological and brain changes at rest before, during, and after 5 days of {IBMT} and relaxation training. During and after training, the {IBMT} group showed significantly better physiological reactions in heart rate, respiratory amplitude and rate, and skin conductance response ({SCR}) than the relaxation control. Differences in heart rate variability ({HRV}) and {EEG} power suggested greater involvement of the autonomic nervous system ({ANS}) in the {IBMT} group during and after training. Imaging data demonstrated stronger subgenual and adjacent ventral anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}) activity in the {IBMT} group. Frontal midline {ACC} theta was correlated with high-frequency {HRV}, suggesting control by the {ACC} over parasympathetic activity. These results indicate that after 5 days of training, the {IBMT} group shows better regulation of the {ANS} by a ventral midfrontal brain system than does the relaxation group. This changed state probably reflects training in the coordination of body and mind given in the {IBMT} but not in the control group.

The historical account of the breakdown in communications between mathematicians and physicists and of the lack of interest in Maxwell's equations constitutes an indictment of the mathematical community. The discovery of the invariance of Maxwell's equations under the Lorentz group had to wait for Minkowski, and some of its simple consequences for Cartan, Weyl and Einstein.

	abstract = {Measures of psychological attributes abound in the social sciences as much as measures of physical properties do in the physical sciences. However, there are crucial differences between the scientific underpinning of measurement. While measurement in the physical sciences is supported by empirical evidence that demonstrates the quantitative nature of the property assessed, measurement in the social sciences is, in large part, made possible only by a vague, discretionary definition of measurement that places hardly any restrictions on empirical data. Traditional psychometric analyses fail to address the requirements of measurement as defined more rigorously in the physical sciences. The construct definitions do not allow for testable predictions; and content validity becomes a matter of highly subjective judgment. In order to improve measurement of psychological attributes, it is suggested to, first, readopt the definition of measurement in the physical sciences; second, to devise an elaborate theory of the construct to be measured that includes the hypothesis of a quantitative attribute; and third, to test the data for the structure implied by the hypothesis of quantity as well as predictions derived from the theory of the construct.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the central nervous mechanisms involved in the broad network that generates and maintains {REM} sleep. Experimental investigations have identified the pontine tegmentum as the critical substrate for {REM} sleep mechanisms. Several pontine structures are involved in the generation of each particular polygraphic event that characterizes {REM} sleep: desynchronization in the electroencephalogram, theta rhythm in the hippocampus, muscle atonia, pontogeniculooccipital waves and rapid eye movements. The pontine tegmentum also holds the region where cholinergic stimulation can trigger all the behavioural and bioelectric signs of {REM} sleep. The exact location has been investigated and amply discussed over the last few years. Studies in the authors{\textgreater} laboratory, mapping the pontine tegmentum with small volume carbachol (a cholinergic agonist) microinjections, have demonstrated that the executive neurons for {REM} sleep generation are neither located in the dorsal part of the pontine tegmentum, nor diffusely spread through the medial pontine reticular formation: they are concentrated in a discrete area in the ventral part of the oral pontine reticular nucleus ({vRPO}). In turn, the {vRPO} has connections with structures involved in the generation of the other states of the sleep-wake cycle as well as with structures responsible for the generation of each of the different events characterizing {REM} sleep. This allows us to propose the {vRPO} as the crucial region for {REM} sleep generation. Related research, with invivo and invitro experiments, into the actions of different neurotransmitters on {vRPO} neurones indicates that not only acetylcholine but other neurotransmitters have an active key role in {vRPO} {REM} sleep generation mechanisms.},

After detailing arguments pro and con, we conclude that the unconsidered use of parcels is never warranted, while, at the same time, the considered use of parcels cannot be dismissed out of hand. In large part, the decision to parcel or not depends on one's philosophical stance regarding scientific inquiry (e.g., empiricist vs. pragmatist) and the substantive goal of a study (e.g., to understand the structure of a set of items or to examine the nature of a set of constructs). Prior to creating parcels, however, we recommend strongly that investigators acquire a thorough understanding of the nature and dimensionality of the items to be parceled. With this knowledge in hand, various techniques for creating parcels can be utilized to minimize potential pitfalls and to optimize the measurement structure of constructs in {SEM} procedures. A number of parceling techniques are described, noting their strengths and weaknesses. Using parcels as indicators of constructs in structural equation models ({SEMs}) has been and remains a controversial practice. Historically, debates on the utility and efficacy of parcels date back over 40 years (e.g., Cattell, 1956; Cattell \& Burdsal, 1975), and the debates have continued in contemporary {SEM} circles (e.g.,},

Social movements and internal problems of traditional psychology are identified as factors in the rise of his psychology, whereas the decline of Critical Psychology in the 1980s and 1990s is attributed to social development, limitations of a systematic-foundational framework, and the emergence of alternative critical approaches.

	abstract = {The authors explored whether meditation training to enhance emotional awareness improves discrimination of subtle emotional feelings hypothesized to guide decision-making. Long-term meditators and nonmeditators were compared on measures of self-reported valence and arousal, skin conductance response ({SCR}), and facial electromyography ({EMG}) to masked and nonmasked emotional pictures, and on measures of heartbeat detection and self-reported emotional awareness. Groups responded similarly to nonmasked pictures. In the masked condition, only controls showed discrimination in valence self-reports. However, meditators reported greater emotional clarity than controls, and meditators with higher clarity had reduced arousal and improved valence discrimination in the masked condition. These findings provide qualified support for the somatic marker hypothesis and suggest that meditation may influence how emotionally ambiguous information is processed, regulated, and represented in conscious awareness.},

This article summarizes the history of the model and its supporting evidence; discusses conceptions of the nature of the factors; and outlines an agenda for theorizing about the origins and operation of the factors.

In so doing, the authors have provided an overview of the theoretical and empirical contributions of the psychology of self-monitoring to the domains of interest: close relationships, consumer behavior, behavior in the workplace, and social interaction. As each of the contributing authors to this special section suggests, much more theoretical and empirical work is in order if the impact of individual differences in self-monitoring for the phenomena reviewed here is to be fully appreciated. Moreover, the four domains of interest represented in this special section by no means exhaust the areas to which theorists and researchers have applied or can apply the psychology of individual differences in self-monitoring. Given the large nomological network that currently exists involving the self-monitoring construct, it is anticipated that the breadth and depth of applications of the psychology of self-monitoring will only continue to expand as it has in the last 30 years since the appearance of the construct in the literature.},

It is a prime measure of the miserly information processing posited by most dual process theories. The original three-item test may be becoming known to potential participants, however. We examined a four-item version that could serve as a substitute for the original. Our data show that it displays a .58 correlation with the original version and that it has very similar relationships with cognitive ability, various thinking dispositions, and with several other rational thinking tasks. Combining the two versions into a seven-item test resulted in a measure of miserly processing with substantial reliability (.72). The seven-item version was a strong independent predictor of performance on rational thinking tasks after the variance accounted for by cognitive ability and thinking dispositions had been partialled out.

Weather forecasts are a familiar example---the more we know about how weather works, the better we can use current observations and seasonal records to predict whether it will rain tomorrow and any disagreement between prediction and observation can be used to refine the weather model. Bayesian statistics embodies this cycle of applying previous theoretical and empirical knowledge to formulate hypotheses, rank them on the basis of observed data and update prior probability estimates and hypotheses using observed data1. This will be our first of a series of columns about Bayesian statistics.

Im Verlauf der historischen Entwicklung der Arbeits- und Organisationspsychologie wurden -- auch unter dem Einfluss jeweils dominierender disziplinärer und zeitgeschichtlicher Theorieströmungen -- ganz unterschiedliche theoretische Ansätze zur Beschreibung, Erklärung und Vorhersage von Arbeitsverhalten bzw. -handeln entwickelt. Im Rahmen dieses Lehrbuchs können daher nur Schlaglichter auf diese Entwicklung geworfen werden. Im Folgenden werden vier bedeutsame theoretische Ansätze des Arbeitshandelns betrachtet und vorgestellt: Verhaltens- und lerntheoretische Ansätze, kognitionspsychologische Ansätze, sowie handlungs- und tätigkeitstheoretische Ansätze.

	abstract = {Biomedical journals and the pharmaceutical industry share the goals of enhancing transparency and expanding access to peer-reviewed research; both industries have recently instituted new policies and guidelines to effect this change. However, while increasing transparency may elevate standards and bring benefits to readers, it will drive a significant increase in manuscript volume, posing challenges to both the journals and industry sponsors. As a result, there is a need to: (1) increase efficiency in the submission process to accommodate the rising manuscript volume and reduce the resource demands on journals, peer reviewers, and authors; and (2) identify suitable venues to publish this research. These shared goals can only be accomplished through close collaboration among stakeholders in the process.In an effort to foster mutual collaboration, members of the pharmaceutical industry and the International Society for Medical Publication Professionals founded a unique collaborative venture in 2008 - the Medical Publishing Insights and Practices initiative ({MPIP}). At an {MPIP} roundtable meeting in September 2009,journal editors, publishers and industry representatives identified and prioritized opportunities to streamline the submission process and requirements, and to support prompt publication and dissemination of clinical trial results in the face of increasing manuscript volume. Journal and sponsor participants agreed that more author education on manuscript preparation and submission was needed to increase efficiency and enhance quality and transparency in the publication of industry-sponsored research. They suggested an authors'guide to help bridge the gap between author practices and editor expectations.To address this unmet educational need, {MPIP} supported development of an Authors' Submission Toolkit to compile best practices in the preparation and submission of manuscripts describing sponsored research.The Toolkit represents a unique collaboration between the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical journals,and reflects both groups' perspectives on how authors can help raise standards and increase efficiency in publishing industry-sponsored studies. The information provided in the toolkit can be useful to help authors navigate the manuscript},

As evidence of that, this book covers more than 400 references from all major conferences and journals. Although the field deals with the natural language text, which is often considered the unstructured data, this book takes a structured approach in introducing the problem with the aim of bridging the unstructured and structured worlds and facilitating qualitative and quantitative analysis of opinions. This is crucial for practical applications. In this book, I first define the problem in order to provide an abstraction or structure to the problem. From the abstraction, we will naturally see its key sub-problems. The subsequent chapters discuss the existing techniques for solving these subproblems.},

Overnight sleep studies were conducted on 40 healthy subjects during a clinical trial at the University of Virginia. The {NAPS} system's measures of heart rate and breathing rate were compared to {ECG}, pulse oximetry, and respiratory inductance plethysmography ({RIP}). The subjects were split into a training dataset and a validation dataset, maintaining similar demographics in each set. The {NAPS} system accurately detected heart rate, averaged over the prescribed 30-s epochs, to within less than 2.72 beats per minute of {ECG}, and accurately detected breathing rate, averaged over the same epochs, to within 2.10 breaths per minute of {RIP} bands used in polysomnography.},

Mindfulness training comprised twice-weekly sessions for 5 weeks, plus home practice (meditation {CDs} were supplied), followed by 5 weeks of home practice. {RESULTS}: There were no significant differences between intervention and waiting-list participants. Secondary analyses combining both groups and comparing scores before and after mindfulness training revealed significant improvement in clinical functioning (p = .013) and mindfulness of distressing thoughts and images (p = .037). {CONCLUSIONS}: Findings on feasibility are encouraging and secondary analyses replicated earlier clinical benefits and showed improved mindfulness of thoughts and images, but not voices.},

In 2 large samples of healthy 14- to 18-year-olds (N = 595), Study 1 supported a single-factor {MAAS}-A structure, along with acceptably high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and both concurrent and incremental validity. In Study 2, with a sample of 102 psychiatric outpatient adolescents age 14-18 years, participants randomized to a mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention showed significant increases in {MAAS}-A scores from baseline to 3-month follow-up, relative to nonsignificant score changes among treatment-as-usual participants. Increases in {MAAS}-A scores among mindfulness-based stress reduction participants were significantly related to beneficial changes in numerous mental health indicators. The findings support the reliability and validity of the {MAAS}-A in normative and mixed psychiatric adolescent populations and suggest that the {MAAS}-A has utility in mindfulness intervention research.},

	abstract = {The contributions of separate sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways to pupillary dilation during a sustained processing task were studied through environmental and pharmacological manipulations. In Experiment 1, 22 healthy volunteers (11 female) performed a serial Subtract 7 task while pupil diameter was recorded both during moderate room light and in darkness. In a control for verbalization, subjects performed an easier Add 1 task. In all conditions, pupil diameter increased significantly during the response period as compared to a pre-verbalization baseline period. Pupillary dilation was increased for the difficult task, and further increase in dilation was associated with recording in light. This suggests a major differential contribution to task difficulty mediated through inhibition of the parasympathetic pathway. In Experiment 2, a subgroup of 12 volunteers (seven female) repeated all conditions at three additional sessions in which one eye was instilled with tropicamide (to block the parasympathetic sphincter muscle), dapiprazole (to block the sympathetic dilator muscle) or placebo. All pharmacological conditions resulted in overall dilation during task performance. Differential performance similar to the placebo condition was seen only in the dapiprazole condition, when parasympathetic activation was intact. The findings suggest that sustained performance during a difficult task is modulated by cortical inhibition of the parasympathetic pathway at the oculomotor nucleus. Moreover, modulation of both ambient light intensity and pharmacological blockade of the final pupillary musculature were observed to provide converging approaches for quantifying the activity of identifiable central autonomic pathways.},

	abstract = {Objectives. To assess whether talking or reading (silently or aloud) could affect heart rate variability ({HRV}) and to what extent these changes require a simultaneous recording of respiratory activity to be correctly interpreted. Background. Sympathetic predominance in the power spectrum obtained from short- and long-term {HRV} recordings predicts a poor prognosis in a number of cardiac diseases. Heart rate variability is often recorded without measuring respiration; slow breaths might artefactually increase low frequency power in {RR} interval ({RR}) and falsely mimic sympathetic activation. Methods. In 12 healthy volunteers we evaluated the effect of free talking and reading, silently and aloud, on respiration, {RR} and blood pressure ({BP}). We also compared spontaneous breathing to controlled breathing and mental arithmetic, silent or aloud. The power in the so called low-({LF}) and high-frequency ({HF}) bands in {RR} and {BP} was obtained from autoregressive power spectrum analysis. Results. Compared with spontaneous breathing, reading silently increased the speed of breathing (p {\textless} 0.05), decreased mean {RR} and {RR} variability and increased {BP}. Reading aloud, free talking and mental arithmetic aloud shifted the respiratory frequency into the {LF} band, thus increasing {LF}\% and decreasing {HF}\% to a similar degree in both {RR} and respiration, with decrease in mean {RR} but with minor differences in crude {RR} variability. Conclusions. Simple mental and verbal activities markedly affect {HRV} through changes in respiratory frequency. This possibility should be taken into account when analyzing {HRV} without simultaneous acquisition and analysis of respiration. (C) 2000 by the American College of Cardiology.},

By “statistical thinking” is meant a focus on ideas that statisticians care about as opposed to technical details of how to put those ideas into practice. By “likelihood emphasis” is meant that the likelihood function and likelihood principle are unifying ideas throughout the text. Another unusual aspect is the use of statistical software as a pedagogical tool. That is, instead of viewing the computer merely as a convenient and accurate calculating device, we use computer calculation and simulation as another way of explaining and helping readers understand the underlying concepts. Our software of choice is R (R Development Core Team [2006]). R and accompanying manuals are available for free download from http://www.r-project.org. You may wish to download An Introduction to R to keep as a reference. It is highly recommended that you try all the examples in R. They will help you understand concepts, give you a little programming experience, and give you facility with a very flexible statistical software package. And don't just try the examples as written.

Since {ABBT} has been shown to be an efficacious treatment in previous studies, the current study focuses on proposed mechanisms of change over the course of therapy. Specifically, the current study focuses on session-by-session changes in two proposed mechanisms of change: acceptance of internal experiences and engagement in meaningful activities. Overall, clients receiving {ABBT} reported an increase in the amount of time spent accepting internal experiences and engaging in valued activities. Change in both acceptance and engagement in meaningful activities was related to responder status at post-treatment and change in these two proposed mechanisms predicted outcome above and beyond change in worry. In addition, change in acceptance was related to reported quality of life at post-treatment. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Reporting p values from statistical significance tests is common in psychology's empirical literature. Sir Ronald Fisher saw the p value as playing a useful role in knowledge development by acting as an 'objective' measure of inductive evidence against the null hypothesis. We review several reasons why the p value is an unobjective and inadequate measure of evidence when statistically testing hypotheses. A common theme throughout many of these reasons is that p values exaggerate the evidence against H0. This, in turn, calls into question the validity of much published work based on comparatively small, including .05, p values. Indeed, if researchers were fully informed about the limitations of the p value as a measure of evidence, this inferential index could not possibly enjoy its ongoing ubiquity. Replication with extension research focusing on sample statistics, effect sizes, and their confidence intervals is a better vehicle for reliable knowledge development than using p values. Fisher would also have agreed with the need for replication research.},

	abstract = {People generally prefer their initials to the other letters of the alphabet, a phenomenon known as the name-letter effect. This effect, researchers have argued, makes people move to certain cities, buy particular brands of consumer products, and choose particular professions (e.g., Angela moves to Los Angeles, Phil buys a Philips {TV}, and Dennis becomes a dentist). In order to establish such associations between people's initials and their behavior, researchers typically carry out statistical analyses of large databases. Current methods of analysis ignore the hierarchical structure of the data, do not naturally handle order-restrictions, and are fundamentally incapable of confirming the null hypothesis. Here we outline a Bayesian hierarchical analysis that avoids these limitations and allows coherent inference both on the level of the individual and on the level of the group. To illustrate our method, we re-analyze two data sets that address the question of whether people are disproportionately likely to live in cities that resemble their name.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome, is often accompanied by psychological distress and increased basal sympathetic tone. In a previous report it was shown that mindfulness-based stress-reduction ({MBSR}) reduced depressive symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia with gains maintained at two months follow-up (Sephton et al., Arthr Rheum 57:77-85, 2007). This second study explores the effects of {MBSR} on basal sympathetic ({SNS}) activation among women with fibromyalgia.

{METHODS}: Participants (n = 24) responded to a television news appearance, newspaper, and radio advertisements. Effects on anxiety, depressive symptoms, and {SNS} activation measures were tested before and after {MBSR} using a within-subjects design.

{RESULTS}: The {MBSR} treatment significantly reduced basal electrodermal (skin conductance level; {SCL}) activity (t = 3.298, p = .005) and {SCL} activity during meditation (t = 4.389, p = .001), consistent with reduced {SNS} activation.

{CONCLUSIONS}: In this small sample, basal {SNS} activity was reduced following {MBSR} treatment. Future studies should assess how {MBSR} may help reduce negative psychological symptoms and attenuate {SNS} activation in fibromyalgia. Further clarification of psychological and physiological responses associated with fibromyalgia may lead to more beneficial treatment.},

The motivation to be accurate enhances use of those beliefs and strategies that are considered most appropriate, whereas the motivation to arrive at particular conclusions enhances use of those that are considered most likely to yield the desired conclusion. There is considerable evidence that people are more likely to arrive at conclusions that they want to arrive at, but their ability to do so is constrained by their ability to construct seemingly reasonable justifications for these conclusions. These ideas can account for a wide variety of research concerned with motivated reasoning.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Patient satisfaction is a function of several variables addressing reasons why it is important to use methods in which these different factors can be isolated and their importance analysed. {OBJECTIVE}: In this project, two methods using this approach were used: the 'Quality from the Patient's Perspective' and the 'Quality, Satisfaction, Performance' models. The aim of the present study is to evaluate these two different methods with respect to application, strengths and weaknesses. {DESIGN}: In the Quality from the Patient's Perspective model, the patient judges the different domains in two dimensions: perceived reality and subjective importance. The Quality, Satisfaction, Performance model uses a multivariate analysis to capture the patient's priorities. Four hundred and sixty forms for each model were distributed to a random sample of patients at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Karolinska Hospital. {MAIN} {MEASURES}: The quality factors 'treatment by the nurse', 'participation', 'information', 'environment' and 'accessibility' were measured. {RESULTS}: On both forms, 'medical care', 'treatment by the doctor' and 'access to nursing treatment' received high scores in perceived reality' while 'accessibility' and 'participation' received low scores. 'Subjective importance' measured directly and indirectly, respectively, in the two models showed high values for 'medical care' and 'treatment by the doctor'. {CONCLUSION}: The advantages of the Quality from the Patient's Perspective model are that it has a comprehensive and solid question bank. The Quality, Satisfaction, Performance model's advantage is its immediate usefulness and its clear graphic presentation. An integration and further development of these two approaches may prove useful.},

This assumption has been challenged conceptually and empirically, but results to date have been inconclusive. In the current study, we took a theory-driven approach in systematically addressing this issue. Results based on two different samples generally supported our expectations of the curvilinear relationships between personality traits, including Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability, and job performance dimensions, including task performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and counterproductive work behaviors. We also hypothesized and found that job complexity moderated the curvilinear personality--performance relationships such that the inflection points after which the relationships disappear were lower for low-complexity jobs than they were for high-complexity jobs. This finding suggests that high levels of the two personality traits examined are more beneficial for performance in high- than low-complexity jobs. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the use of personality in personnel selection.},

An animal physiology course was studied over a two-year period (Year 1, n = 42 students; Year 2, n = 30 students) to determine the effects of student-led seminar (andragogical) and lecture (pedagogical) teaching methods on students' retention of information and performance. For each year of the study, the course was divided into two time periods. The first half was dedicated to instructor-led lectures, followed by a control survey in which the students rated the efficiency of pedagogical learning on a five-point Likert scale from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree). During the second period, students engaged in andragogical learning via peer-led seminars. An experimental survey was then administered to students using the same scale as above to determine students' preferred teaching method. Raw examination scores and survey results from both halves of the course were statistically analyzed by {ANOVA} with Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. By the end of the study, student preference for peer-led seminars increased [mean +/- {SD}: (2.47 +/- 0.94)/(4.03 +/- 1.36), P {\textless} 0.04], and examination scores significantly increased [mean +/- {SD}: (73.91\% +/- 13.18)/(85.77 +/- 5.22), P {\textless} 0.001]. A majority of students (68.8\%) preferred a method that contained peer-led seminars and instructor-led lectures. These results may indicate that integration of active and passive learning into undergraduate courses may have greater benefit in terms of student preference and performance than either method alone.},

In contrast, more general psychopathological impairment, such as depression, was not related to self-esteem discrepancies.

The history of scientific measurement, from antiquity to the present may be interpreted as revealing a progressive deepening in the understanding of this position. First, the concept of ratio was broadened to include ratios between incommensurable magnitudes; second, the concept of a quantitative attribute was broadened to include non-extensive quantities; third, quantitative structure and its relations to ratios and real numbers were elaborated; and finally, the issue of empirically distinguishing between quantitative and non-quantitative structures was addressed. This interpretation of measurement understands it in a way that is continuous with scientific investigation in general, i.e., as an attempt to discover independently existing facts. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To review and synthesize the state of research on a variety of meditation practices, including: the specific meditation practices examined; the research designs employed and the conditions and outcomes examined; the efficacy and effectiveness of different meditation practices for the three most studied conditions; the role of effect modifiers on outcomes; and the effects of meditation on physiological and neuropsychological outcomes. {DATA} {SOURCES}: Comprehensive searches were conducted in 17 electronic databases of medical and psychological literature up to September 2005. Other sources of potentially relevant studies included hand searches, reference tracking, contact with experts, and gray literature searches. {REVIEW} {METHODS}: A Delphi method was used to develop a set of parameters to describe meditation practices. Included studies were comparative, on any meditation practice, had more than 10 adult participants, provided quantitative data on health-related outcomes, and published in English. Two independent reviewers assessed study relevance, extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies. {RESULTS}: Five broad categories of meditation practices were identified (Mantra meditation, Mindfulness meditation, Yoga, Tai Chi, and Qi Gong). Characterization of the universal or supplemental components of meditation practices was precluded by the theoretical and terminological heterogeneity among practices. Evidence on the state of research in meditation practices was provided in 813 predominantly poor-quality studies. The three most studied conditions were hypertension, other cardiovascular diseases, and substance abuse. Sixty-five intervention studies examined the therapeutic effect of meditation practices for these conditions. Meta-analyses based on low-quality studies and small numbers of hypertensive participants showed that {TM}(R), Qi Gong and Zen Buddhist meditation significantly reduced blood pressure. Yoga helped reduce stress. Yoga was no better than Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction at reducing anxiety in patients with cardiovascular diseases. No results from substance abuse studies could be combined. The role of effect modifiers in meditation practices has been neglected in the scientific literature. The physiological and neuropsychological effects of meditation practices have been evaluated in 312 poor-quality studies. Meta-analyses of results from 55 studies indicated that some meditation practices produced significant changes in healthy participants. {CONCLUSIONS}: Many uncertainties surround the practice of meditation. Scientific research on meditation practices does not appear to have a common theoretical perspective and is characterized by poor methodological quality. Firm conclusions on the effects of meditation practices in healthcare cannot be drawn based on the available evidence. Future research on meditation practices must be more rigorous in the design and execution of studies and in the analysis and reporting of results.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: This study examines differences in computer-related self-efficacy and anxiety in subgroups of older adults, and changes in those measures after exposure to a systematic training program and subsequent computer use.

{METHODS}: Participants were volunteers in the Intelligent Systems for Assessment of Aging Changes study ({ISAAC}) carried out by the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology. Participants were administered two questionnaires before training and again 1 year later, which were related to computer self-efficacy and anxiety. Continuous recording of computer use was also assessed for a subset of participants.

{RESULTS}: Baseline comparisons by sex, age, education, living arrangement, and computer proficiency, but not cognitive status, yielded significant differences in confidence and anxiety related to specific aspects of computer use. At 1-year follow-up, participants reported less anxiety and greater confidence. However, the benefits of training and exposure varied by group and task. Comparisons based on cognitive status showed that the cognitively intact participants benefited more from training and/or experience with computers than did participants with mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}), who after 1 year continued to report less confidence and more anxiety regarding certain aspects of computer use.

{CONCLUSION}: After 1 year of consistent computer use, cognitively intact participants in this study reported reduced levels of anxiety and increased self-confidence in their ability to perform specific computer tasks. Participants with {MCI} at baseline were less likely to demonstrate increased efficacy or confidence than their cognitively intact counterparts.},

	abstract = {First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive, process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it. But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence.},

An- schließend wurden Selbsteinschätzungen des Narzissmus zu diesen Dimensionen in Beziehung gesetzt. Narzissmus hing mit allen drei Dimensionen zusammen: Hoch Narzisstische tendierten zur Distanzierung vom Partner durch Untreue, zeigten Verunsicherung und Eifersucht und waren auf der Grundlage einer pragmatischen Einstellung stark austauschorientiert.

The earlier results on additive representations are briefly surveyed. Generalizations to nonadditive structures are outlined, and their more complex uniqueness results are described. The latter leads to a definition of scale type in terms of the symmetries (automorphisms) of the underlying qualitative structure. The major result is that for any measurement onto the real numbers, only three possible scale types exist that are both rich in symmetries but not too redundant: ratio, interval, and another lying between them. The possible numerical representations for concatenation structures corresponding to these scale types are completely described. The interval scale case leads to a generalization of subjective expected-utility theory that copes with some empirical violations of the classical theory. Partial attempts to axiomatize concatenation structures of these three scale types are described. Such structures are of interest because they make clear that there is a rich class of nonadditive concatenation and conjoint structures with representations of the same scale types as those used in physics.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To test the feasibility of creating a valid and reliable checklist with the following features: appropriate for assessing both randomised and non-randomised studies; provision of both an overall score for study quality and a profile of scores not only for the quality of reporting, internal validity (bias and confounding) and power, but also for external validity. {DESIGN}: A pilot version was first developed, based on epidemiological principles, reviews, and existing checklists for randomised studies. Face and content validity were assessed by three experienced reviewers and reliability was determined using two raters assessing 10 randomised and 10 non-randomised studies. Using different raters, the checklist was revised and tested for internal consistency (Kuder-Richardson 20), test-retest and inter-rater reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient and sign rank test; kappa statistics), criterion validity, and respondent burden. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: The performance of the checklist improved considerably after revision of a pilot version. The Quality Index had high internal consistency ({KR}-20: 0.89) as did the subscales apart from external validity ({KR}-20: 0.54). Test-retest (r 0.88) and inter-rater (r 0.75) reliability of the Quality Index were good. Reliability of the subscales varied from good (bias) to poor (external validity). The Quality Index correlated highly with an existing, established instrument for assessing randomised studies (r 0.90). There was little difference between its performance with non-randomised and with randomised studies. Raters took about 20 minutes to assess each paper (range 10 to 45 minutes). {CONCLUSIONS}: This study has shown that it is feasible to develop a checklist that can be used to assess the methodological quality not only of randomised controlled trials but also non-randomised studies. It has also shown that it is possible to produce a checklist that provides a profile of the paper, alerting reviewers to its particular methodological strengths and weaknesses. Further work is required to improve the checklist and the training of raters in the assessment of external validity.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Sleep loss and sleep disruption are common in critically ill patients and may adversely affect clinical outcomes. Although polysomnography remains the most accurate and reliable way to measure sleep, it is costly and impractical for regular use in the intensive care unit. This study evaluates the accuracy of two other methods currently used for measuring sleep, actigraphy (monitoring of gross motor activity) and behavioural assessment by the bedside nurse, by comparing them to overnight polysomnography in critically ill patients.

{DESIGN}: Observational study with simultaneous polysomnography, actigraphy and behavioural assessment of sleep.

{SETTING}: Medical-surgical intensive care unit.

{PATIENTS} {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: Twelve stable, critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients [68 (13) years, Glasgow coma scale 11 (0)].

{INTERVENTIONS}: None.

{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Sleep was severely disrupted, reflected by decreased total sleep time and sleep efficiency, high frequency of arousals and awakenings and abnormal sleep architecture. Actigraphy overestimated total sleep time and sleep efficiency. The overall agreement between actigraphy and polysomnography was {\textless}65\%. Nurse assessment underestimated the number of awakenings from sleep. Estimated total sleep time, sleep efficiency and number of awakenings by nurse assessment did not correlate with polysomnographic findings.

{CONCLUSIONS}: Actigraphy and behavioural assessment by the bedside nurse are inaccurate and unreliable methods to monitor sleep in critically ill patients.},

Strong Dirichlet model support for both the ordinal and quantitative components of unfolding was only found in datasets that satisfied at least double cancellation. In contrast, the Item Response Theory ({IRT}) simple hyperbolic cosine model for pairwise preferences ({SHCMpp}, Andrich 1995) fitted all datasets. The paper concluded the {SHCMpp} is suited to the instrumental rather than scientific task (Michell 2000) of psychological measurement; with the caveat of the problematic chi square fit statistic.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Medical communication can be a stressful experience for both doctors and patients. In particular, inexperienced doctors facing the demanding task of a bad news consultation may experience high levels of distress. The aim of this exploratory study is to test students' differential cardiovascular reactivity to history taking and bad news consultations with a simulated patient, and to test the relation between the students' self-reported stressfulness of the consultation and their cardiovascular response.

{METHODS}: Fourth and fifth year medical students (n=20) conducted a history taking ({HT}) and a bad news ({BN}) consultation in a randomized order with a standardized patient. Heart rate ({HR}), mean arterial pressure ({MAP}), cardiac output ({CO}) and systemic vascular resistance ({SVR}) were assessed by way of the Finapres-technique in four conditions: rest, reading aloud, and during both consultations. Self-reported stress was assessed before and after each interview using the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory ({STAI}), and a visual analogue scale ({VAS}).

{RESULTS}: Both {HT} and {BN} provoked more cardiovascular stress than reading. Bad-news provoked the highest {HR} and {CO} responses compared to all other conditions, and had a greater impact when it was the student's first consultation. The {STAI} and {VAS} data showed some correlations with the cardiovascular stress measures and a comparable but less significant pattern in stress response.

{DISCUSSION}: The effect of order of the {HT} and {BN} consultations on the students' stress levels suggests an additional impact of novelty and habituation. Unfamiliarity with the patient may enhance the stressfulness of the task of breaking bad news.},

	title = {A nontechnical introduction to latent class models},
	abstract = {The linear factor analysis ({FA}) model is a popular tool for exploratory data analysis or, more precisely, for assessing the dimensionality of sets of items. Although it is well known that it is meant for continuous observed indica- tors, it is often used with dichotomous, ordinal, and other types of discrete variables, yielding results that might be incorrect. Not only parameter es- timates may be biased, but also goodness-of-fit indices cannot be trusted. Magidson and Vermunt (2001) presented a nonlinear factor-analytic model based on latent class ({LC}) analysis that is especially suited for dealing with categorical indicators, such as dichotomous, ordinal, and nominal variables,and counts. The approach is called latent class factor analysis ({LCFA}) be- cause it combines elements from {LC} and traditional {FA}. This {LCFA} model is one of the {LC} models implemented in the Latent {GOLD} program (Vermunt \& Magidson, 2000, 2003). A disadvantage of the {LCFA} model is, however, that its parameters may be somewhat more difficult to interpret than the typical factor-analytic co- efficients -- factor loadings , factor-item correlations, factor correlations, and communalities . In order to overcome this problem, we propose using a linear approximation of the maximum likelihood estimates obtained with a {LCFA} model. This makes it possible to provide the same type of output measures as in standard {FA}, while retaining the fact that the underlying factor structure is identified by the more reliable nonlinear factor-analytic model.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Mindfulness-based stress reduction ({MBSR}) is a structured group program that employs mindfulness meditation to alleviate suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. The program, nonreligious and nonesoteric, is based upon a systematic procedure to develop enhanced awareness of moment-to-moment experience of perceptible mental processes. The approach assumes that greater awareness will provide more veridical perception, reduce negative affect and improve vitality and coping. In the last two decades, a number of research reports appeared that seem to support many of these claims. We performed a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies of health-related studies related to {MBSR}.

{METHODS}: Sixty-four empirical studies were found, but only 20 reports met criteria of acceptable quality or relevance to be included in the meta-analysis. Reports were excluded due to (1) insufficient information about interventions, (2) poor quantitative health evaluation, (3) inadequate statistical analysis, (4) mindfulness not being the central component of intervention, or (5) the setting of intervention or sample composition deviating too widely from the health-related {MBSR} program. Acceptable studies covered a wide spectrum of clinical populations (e.g., pain, cancer, heart disease, depression, and anxiety), as well as stressed nonclinical groups. Both controlled and observational investigations were included. Standardized measures of physical and mental well-being constituted the dependent variables of the analysis.

{RESULTS}: Overall, both controlled and uncontrolled studies showed similar effect sizes of approximately 0.5 (P{\textless}.0001) with homogeneity of distribution.

{CONCLUSION}: Although derived from a relatively small number of studies, these results suggest that {MBSR} may help a broad range of individuals to cope with their clinical and nonclinical problems.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many patients report symptomatic relief after undergoing arthroscopy of the knee for osteoarthritis, but it is unclear how the procedure achieves this result. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of arthroscopy for osteoarthritis of the knee. {METHODS}: A total of 180 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly assigned to receive arthroscopic débridement, arthroscopic lavage, or placebo surgery. Patients in the placebo group received skin incisions and underwent a simulated débridement without insertion of the arthroscope. Patients and assessors of outcome were blinded to the treatment-group assignment. Outcomes were assessed at multiple points over a 24-month period with the use of five self-reported scores--three on scales for pain and two on scales for function--and one objective test of walking and stair climbing. A total of 165 patients completed the trial. {RESULTS}: At no point did either of the intervention groups report less pain or better function than the placebo group. For example, mean (+/-{SD}) scores on the Knee-Specific Pain Scale (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe pain) were similar in the placebo, lavage, and débridement groups: 48.9+/-21.9, 54.8+/-19.8, and 51.7+/-22.4, respectively, at one year (P=0.14 for the comparison between placebo and lavage; P=0.51 for the comparison between placebo and débridement) and 51.6+/-23.7, 53.7+/-23.7, and 51.4+/-23.2, respectively, at two years (P=0.64 and P=0.96, respectively). Furthermore, the 95 percent confidence intervals for the differences between the placebo group and the intervention groups exclude any clinically meaningful difference. {CONCLUSIONS}: In this controlled trial involving patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, the outcomes after arthroscopic lavage or arthroscopic débridement were no better than those after a placebo procedure.},

	abstract = {Ss overheard an epileptic seizure. They believed either that they alone heard the emergency, or that 1 or 4 unseen others were also present. As predicted the presence of other bystanders reduced the individual's feelings of personal responsibility and lowered his speed of reporting (p {\textless} .01). In groups of size 3, males reported no faster than females, and females reported no slower when the 1 other bystander was a male rather than a female. In general, personality and background measures were not predictive of helping. Bystander inaction in real-life emergencies is often explained by "apathy," "alienation," and "anomie." This experiment suggests that the explanation may lie more in the bystander's response to other observers than in his indifference to the victim.},

There was good agreement between {PHQ} diagnoses and those of independent mental health professionals (for the diagnosis of any 1 or more {PHQ} disorder, κ = 0.65; overall accuracy, 85\%; sensitivity, 75\%; specificity, 90\%), similar to the original {PRIME}-{MD}. Patients with {PHQ} diagnoses had more functional impairment, disability days, and health care use than did patients without {PHQ} diagnoses (for all group main effects, P{\textless}.001). The average time required of the physician to review the {PHQ} was far less than to administer the original {PRIME}-{MD} ({\textless}3 minutes for 85\% vs 16\% of the cases). Although 80\% of the physicians reported that routine use of the {PHQ} would be useful, new management actions were initiated or planned for only 117 (32\%) of the 363 patients with 1 or more {PHQ} diagnoses not previously recognized.Conclusion Our study suggests that the {PHQ} has diagnostic validity comparable to the original clinician-administered {PRIME}-{MD}, and is more efficient to use.},

The 39-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire ({FFMQ}) has been developed as a reliable and valid comprehensive instrument for assessing different aspects of mindfulness in community and student samples. In this study, the psychometric properties of the Dutch {FFMQ} were assessed in a sample of 376 adults with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Construct validity was examined with confirmatory factor analyses and by relating the {FFMQ} to measures of psychological symptoms, well-being, experiential avoidance, and the personality factors neuroticism and openness to experience. In addition, a 24-item short form of the {FFMQ} ({FFMQ}-{SF}) was developed and assessed in the same sample and cross-validated in an independent sample of patients with fibromyalgia. Confirmatory factor analyses showed acceptable model fit for a correlated five-factor structure of the {FFMQ} and good model fit for the structure of the {FFMQ}-{SF}. The replicability of the five-factor structure of the {FFMQ}-{SF} was confirmed in the fibromyalgia sample. Both instruments proved highly sensitive to change. It is concluded that both the {FFMQ} and the {FFMQ}-{SF} are reliable and valid instruments for use in adults with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety.},

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses support a two-factor solution, corresponding to the two constituent components of the construct. Good internal consistency was demonstrated, and relationships with other constructs were largely as expected. As predicted, significant differences were found between the nonclinical and clinical samples in levels of awareness and acceptance. The awareness and acceptance subscales were not correlated, suggesting that these two constructs can be examined independently. Potential theoretical and applied uses of the measure are discussed.},

Patients with previous cancer diagnoses, too frail/mentally unfit, with evidence of brain metastases and unable/unwilling to give informed consent were excluded. Psychometric testing assessed the hypothesized scale structure, scale reliability, construct validity and acceptability of the {IN}-{PATSAT}32. {RESULTS}: A high response rate (100\%) and low missing data (0.05\%) confirmed the acceptability of the {IN}-{PATSAT}32. The hypothesized scale structure was confirmed with 100\% item-convergent and 98.6\% item-discriminant validity, and a scaling success rate, defined as items correlating significantly higher (more than 1.96 standard errors) with its own scale (corrected for overlap) than with another scale, of 97.9\%. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for internal consistency exceeded 0.70 in all scales. Construct validity was confirmed with inter-scale correlations, which were all statistically significant (P{\textless}0.01) and were of moderate-to-high magnitude, evidence that they were measuring distinct dimensions of patient satisfaction. {CONCLUSION}: The translated version of the {IN}-{PATSAT}32 has proved to be a reliable and valid measure of satisfaction with cancer care in patients with heterogeneous cancer diagnoses in Sri Lanka.},

We performed a randomized, controlled study on the effects on brain and immune function of a well-known and widely used 8-week clinical training program in mindfulness meditation applied in a work environment with healthy employees. {METHODS}: We measured brain electrical activity before and immediately after, and then 4 months after an 8-week training program in mindfulness meditation. Twenty-five subjects were tested in the meditation group. A wait-list control group (N = 16) was tested at the same points in time as the meditators. At the end of the 8-week period, subjects in both groups were vaccinated with influenza vaccine. {RESULTS}: We report for the first time significant increases in left-sided anterior activation, a pattern previously associated with positive affect, in the meditators compared with the nonmeditators. We also found significant increases in antibody titers to influenza vaccine among subjects in the meditation compared with those in the wait-list control group. Finally, the magnitude of increase in left-sided activation predicted the magnitude of antibody titer rise to the vaccine. {CONCLUSIONS}: These findings demonstrate that a short program in mindfulness meditation produces demonstrable effects on brain and immune function. These findings suggest that meditation may change brain and immune function in positive ways and underscore the need for additional research.},

Likewise, the ability to learn and categorize novel concepts forms an indispensable part of human cognition. However, very little is known about the relationship between working memory and categorization, and modeling in category learning has thus far been largely uninformed by knowledge about people's memory processes. This article reports a large study (N = 113) that related people's working memory capacity ({WMC}) to their category-learning performance using the 6 problem types of Shepard, Hovland, and Jenkins (1961). Structural equation modeling revealed a strong relationship between {WMC} and category learning, with a single latent variable accommodating performance on all 6 problems. A model of categorization ({ALCOVE}) was fit to the individual data and a single latent variable was sufficient to capture the variation among associative learning parameters across all problems. The data and modeling suggest that working memory mediates category learning across a broad range of tasks.},

	abstract = {Sex differences in children's toy play are robust and similar across cultures [1,2]. They include girls tending to play more with dolls and boys more with wheeled toys and pretend weaponry. This pattern is explained by socialization by elders and peers, male rejection of opposite-sex behavior and innate sex differences in activity preferences that are facilitated by specific toys [1]. Evidence for biological factors is controversial but mounting. For instance, girls who have been exposed to high fetal androgen levels are known to make relatively masculine toy choices [3]. Also, when presented with sex-stereotyped human toys, captive female monkeys play more with typically feminine toys, whereas male monkeys play more with masculine toys [1]. In human and nonhuman primates, juvenile females demonstrate a greater interest in infants, and males in rough-and-tumble play. This sex difference in activity preferences parallels adult behavior and may contribute to differences in toy play [1]. Here, we present the first evidence of sex differences in use of play objects in a wild primate, in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We find that juveniles tend to carry sticks in a manner suggestive of rudimentary doll play and, as in children and captive monkeys, this behavior is more common in females than in males. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The 2nd main task is to apply an analysis of appraisal patterns and the core relational themes that they produce to a number of commonly identified emotions. Anger, anxiety, sadness, and pride (to include 1 positive emotion) are used as illustrations. The purpose is to show the capability of a cognitive-motivational-relational theory to explain and predict the emotions. The role of coping in emotion is also discussed, and the article ends with a response to criticisms of a phenomenological, folk-theory outlook.},

	doi = {10.1145/383952.383974},
	abstract = {Support Vector Machines ({SVMs}) are a relatively new learning method used for binary classification. The basic idea is to find a hyperplane which separates the d-dimensional data perfectly into its two classes. However, since example data is often not linearly separable, {SVMs} introduce the notion of a kernel induced feature space which casts the data into a higher dimensional space where the data is separable. Typically, casting into such a space would cause problems computationally, and with overfitting. The key insight used in {SVMs} is that the higher-dimensional space doesnt need to be dealt with directly (as it turns out, only the formula for the dot-product in that space is needed), which eliminates the above concerns. Furthermore, the {VC}-dimension (a measure of a systems likelihood to perform well on unseen data) of {SVMs} can be explicitly calculated, unlike other learning methods like neural networks, for which there is no measure. Overall, {SVMs} are intuitive, theoretically well- founded, and have shown to be practically successful. {SVMs} have also been extended to solve regression tasks (where the system is trained to output a numerical value, rather than yes/no classification).},

Bark was sampled at 0, 3, and 43 days after wounding and analysed using a focused Nd:{YAG} laser (266 nm). Intensities of (13) C, (25)Mg, (27)Al, (31)P, (32)S, (39)K, (48)Ca, (55)Mn, (57)Fe, (63)Cu and (64)Zn were measured by {ICP}-{MS} to study elemental distribution across the bark samples during the wound repair process. A clear accumulation of Mg, P and K at the boundary zone between the lesion and healthy tissue was detected in the wounded samples and was more distinctive at 43 than at 3 days after treatment. This zone of accumulation mapped onto the position of formation of the ligno-suberised boundary zone and differentiation of the wound periderm. These accumulations suggest major roles for Mg, P and K in the non-specific response of Sitka spruce both to wounding, possibly as co-factors to enzymes and energy utilisation. The {LA}-{ICP}-{MS} method developed in this work proved useful to study spatial element distribution across bark samples and has great potential for applications in other areas of plant pathology research.},

The growing use of activity-based monitoring (actigraphy) in sleep medicine and sleep research has enriched and challenged traditional sleep-monitoring techniques. This review summarizes the empirical data on the validity of actigraphy in assessing sleep-wake patterns and assessing clinical and control groups ranging in age from infancy to elderly. An overview of sleep-related actigraphic studies is also included. Actigraphy provides useful measures of sleep-wake schedule and sleep quality. The data also suggest that actigraphy, despite its limitations, may be a useful, cost-effective method for assessing specific sleep disorders, such as insomnia and schedule disorders, and for monitoring their treatment process. Methodological issues such as the proper use of actigraphy and possible artifacts have not been systematically addressed in clinical research and practice.},

Probably the most frequently used instrument is Beck's Depression Inventory ({BDI}). The simplified {BDI} ({BDI}-S) is a more efficient version of the {BDI} that has been shown to be no less reliable or valid. As the {BDI}-S has not yet been subjected to rigorous tests of Item Response Theory, it is the aim of the present paper to conduct such an analysis using the Rasch model. This study subjected a simplified version of the {BDI} consisting of 20 items ({BDI}-S20) to a Rasch analysis in a sample of N=5,035 participants. The scale, minus one misfitting item ({BDI}-S19), yielded a good approximation to Rasch assumptions. Moderate differential item functioning ({DIF}) was present. It is concluded that the {BDI}-S19 is an internally valid instrument for assessing depression, although some room for improvement exists.},

The catalog prerequisites for the course are a full year of calculus. The book can be subdivided into three basic parts. The first part includes the introductions and elementary descriptive statistics; I want the students to be knee-deep in data right out of the gate. The second part is the study of probability, which begins at the basics of sets and the equally likely model, journeys past discrete/continuous random variables, and continues through to multivariate distributions. The chapter on sampling distributions paves the way to the third part, which is in- ferential statistics. This last part includes point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and finishes with introductions to selected topics in applied statistics.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Random forests are becoming increasingly popular in many scientific fields because they can cope with "small n large p" problems, complex interactions and even highly correlated predictor variables. Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables.

{RESULTS}: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure.

{CONCLUSION}: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach.},

	volume = {1},
	url = {http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=ED533155},
	abstract = {To promote student engagement, professors must actively seek to create the conditions that foster engagement. Chickering and Gamson (1987) suggest that good practices in undergraduate education are ones that: encourage student-faculty contact, develop reciprocity and cooperation among students, encourage active learning, provide students with prompt feedback, emphasize time on task, communicate high expectations and respect diverse talents and ways of knowing. The purpose of the book is to provide the reader with a variety of techniques that can be used to foster student engagement. The techniques include ways to enhance the level of academic challenge, promote active and collaborative learning, increase student-faculty interaction, provide enriching educational experiences, and create supportive learning environments. The book is divided into six sections. The first section describes factors that promote student engagement and the learning outcomes related to student engagement. The second and third sections describe programs that promote student engagement and include programs that can be implemented at the course level, programs that can be offered by a department, programs that provide for community involvement, institution-wide programs, as well as national programs. Instructors can enhance student engagement by encouraging students to become more active participants in their education. Section 4 of the book provides a number of techniques that can be used to promote active participation in the classroom. Several opportunities for student engagement are described in Section 5. The final section of the book describes several innovative approaches on how to assess student engagement. Section 1, Why and How Engagement Matters, contains: (1) Factors that Promote Student Engagement (Corey L. Guenther and Richard L.

	abstract = {{McGrath} (2005/this issue) has published a very significant article; it is significant because it examines the substantive issue of construct validity in a simple and informative way, noting the confusions apparent in how constructs and their variables are defined, used, and interpreted within the domain of personality and individual differences. This is a careful, thoughtful, article that quietly proceeds to outline the problems with current thinking and approaches to defining and using constructs in psychology. {McGrath} also suggests how some of these problems might be addressed. I note that {McGrath} appears to miss what might be considered an obvious rejoinder to some of his arguments, that is, the use of latent variable and item response theory. Some consideration is given to these arguments. However, a cursory examination shows that although these new methodologies offer many opportunities for new stochastic questionnaire data modeling and the construction of "instant" latent variables, the same problems caused by lack of attention to measurement and meaning remain. I find I am in agreement with many of the author's views and arguments, but I also find myself wondering whether modern psychometrics and individual differences research methods is now so dominated by psychological statisticians that any thought of substantive scientific innovation in this area that deals more properly with measurement and meaning is long gone. I think the answers to the question "What if there was no psychometrics?" would be most illuminating.},

Of the hypothesized problems, perhaps the most worrying is a worsening of positive-outcome bias. A system that disfavours negative results not only distorts the scientific literature directly, but might also discourage high-risk projects and pressure scientists to fabricate and falsify their data. This study analysed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers that, having declared to have “tested” a hypothesis, reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of positive supports has grown by over 22\% between 1990 and 2007, with significant differences between disciplines and countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over the years, significantly fewer positive results than Asian countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European countries (and in particular the United Kingdom). Methodological artefacts cannot explain away these patterns, which support the hypotheses that research is becoming less pioneering and/or that the objectivity with which results are produced and published is decreasing.},

We were interested in determining whether adolescents who bully others enjoy a key evolutionary benefit: increased dating and mating (sexual) opportunities. This hypothesis was tested in two independent samples consisting of 334 adolescents and 144 university students. The data partly supported our prediction that bullying, but not victimization, would predict dating behavior. The data for sexual behavior more clearly supported our hypothesis that bullying behavior predicts an increase in sexual opportunities even when accounting for age, sex, and self-reports of attractiveness, likeability, and peer victimization. These results are generally congruent with the hypothesis that bullying perpetration is, at least in part, an evolutionary adaptive behavior.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To quantify women's satisfaction with delivery care in informal settlements of Nairobi, Kenya, and to determine characteristics of women and delivery care associated with satisfaction. {DESIGN}: Household survey data analysis of 1266 women who delivered in health facilities in 2004 or 2005. {SETTING}: Two densely populated informal settlements 7 and 12 km from Nairobi's center, where residents work primarily in the nearby industrial area or in the informal sector. Outcome Satisfaction was assessed by whether women would recommend the delivery care facility and deliver there again. {RESULTS}: Over half (56\%) of women would both recommend and deliver again in the same facility. In multivariate analysis, women's satisfaction with delivery care was associated with greater provider empathy ({OR} = 3.68, 95\% {CI} 2.27, 5.97). Women's satisfaction with delivery care was also associated with the pregnancy having been wanted ({OR} = 2.75, 95\% {CI} 1.82, 4.14) or mistimed vs. unwanted. Women delivering at private facilities in the settlement near the industrial area were more satisfied than women delivering at private facilities in the more distant and marginalized settlement ({OR} = 2.12, 95\% {CI} 1.45, 3.09). The association of women's satisfaction and provider empathy was stronger among women who experienced complications compared to those who did not. {CONCLUSION}: Health providers should be sensitized to the finding that unintended pregnancy is associated with lower satisfaction with delivery care. Maternal health programmes should focus on increasing provider empathy, especially for women who experience complications, in both private and government health facilities.},

Evidence from the diverse, yet completely relevant arenas of controlled research and the working world of influence professionals is examined in light of six basic (and very powerful) principles of psychology that direct human behavior: reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity. The ideal supplement for students of psychology, management, sales, marketing, and persuasion, and a fascinating read for anyone interested in the power and tactics of influence, this text demonstrates how influence affects our daily lives and offers "defense" sections that show how to resist undue influence.

No single therapeutic perspective has been able to encompass within its own theoretical framework all the ways in which emotion plays a role in therapeutic change. A comprehensive, constructive theory of emotion helps transcend the differences in the therapeutic schools by viewing emotion as a complex synthesis of expressive motor, schematic, and conceptual information that provides organisms with information about their responses to situations that helps them orient adaptively in the environment. In addition to improved theory, increased precision in the assessment of affective functioning in therapy, as well as greater specification of different emotional change processes and means of facilitating these, will allow the role of emotion in change to be studied more effectively. A number of different change processes involving emotion are discussed, as well as principles of emotionally focused intervention that help access emotion and promote emotional restructuring.},

	abstract = {We examined the neural basis of self-regulation in individuals from a cohort of preschoolers who performed the delay-of-gratification task 4 decades ago. Nearly 60 individuals, now in their mid-forties, were tested on "hot" and "cool" versions of a go/nogo task to assess whether delay of gratification in childhood predicts impulse control abilities and sensitivity to alluring cues (happy faces). Individuals who were less able to delay gratification in preschool and consistently showed low self-control abilities in their twenties and thirties performed more poorly than did high delayers when having to suppress a response to a happy face but not to a neutral or fearful face. This finding suggests that sensitivity to environmental hot cues plays a significant role in individuals' ability to suppress actions toward such stimuli. A subset of these participants (n = 26) underwent functional imaging for the first time to test for biased recruitment of frontostriatal circuitry when required to suppress responses to alluring cues. Whereas the prefrontal cortex differentiated between nogo and go trials to a greater extent in high delayers, the ventral striatum showed exaggerated recruitment in low delayers. Thus, resistance to temptation as measured originally by the delay-of-gratification task is a relatively stable individual difference that predicts reliable biases in frontostriatal circuitries that integrate motivational and control processes.},

{RESULTS}/{CONCLUSIONS}: P-values in scientific studies are used to determine whether a null hypothesis formulated before the performance of the study is to be accepted or rejected. In exploratory studies, p-values enable the recognition of any statistically noteworthy findings. Confidence intervals provide information about a range in which the true value lies with a certain degree of probability, as well as about the direction and strength of the demonstrated effect. This enables conclusions to be drawn about the statistical plausibility and clinical relevance of the study findings. It is often useful for both statistical measures to be reported in scientific articles, because they provide complementary types of information.},

Main outcome measure Psychometric properties of both the 15-item (complete) and 3-item (shortened) versions of the {CTM} in Hebrew and Arabic. Reliability established using internal consistency with Cronbach's-alpha. Exploratory factor analysis conducted using Varimax rotation. Convergent validity determined with Pearson correlation and {ANOVA} tests.: Three hundred and eighteen Hebrew- and Arabic-speaking oncology patients completed the questionnaire. Cronbach's-alpha for the questionnaire was 0.94 and 0.90 for the Hebrew and the Arabic versions, respectively. Factor analysis resulted in three factors in each of the translated versions with a cumulative variance of 73.41\% and 69.2\% in the Hebrew and Arabic versions, respectively. Tests of the convergent validity showed that the measure is correlated with health status and that the shortened and complete versions' ratings are consistent across different patient groups.: The translated Hebrew and Arabic versions of the questionnaire are reliable and valid instruments to assess patients' transitions across settings in diverse populations.},

Multilevel regression analysis showed significant associations between patients' assessments and patient and practice characteristics. Patients from smaller practices (one to three general practitioners) reported better access to care compared with larger practices. Patients from urban areas were more satisfied with patient-centredness than those from rural areas. Self-reported health status and age had a positive and home ownership, employment and education, and patients from non-English-speaking countries a negative relationship with both scores. Females were more satisfied with patient-centredness. {CONCLUSIONS}: Patient assessments of quality of care and patient-centredness were strongly associated with practice and patient characteristics. This has important implications for interpreting assessments of the quality of primary care, and for policy and practice measures designed to improve this.},

Patients were asked to evaluate their overall experience of this episode of care and to complete the Picker Inpatient Survey questionnaire on specific aspects of their care. {SAMPLE}: Patients aged 18 and over presenting at five hospitals within one {NHS} trust in Scotland. {METHOD}: 3592 questionnaires were mailed to patients' homes within 1 month of discharge from hospital during a 12 month period. Two reminders were sent to non-responders; 2249 (65\%) questionnaires were returned. {RESULTS}: Almost 90\% of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with their period of inpatient care. Age and overall self-assessed health were only weakly associated with satisfaction. A multiple linear regression indicated that the major determinants of patient satisfaction were physical comfort, emotional support, and respect for patient preferences. However, many patients who reported their satisfaction with the care they received also indicated problems with their inpatient care as measured on the Picker Inpatient Survey; 55\% of respondents who rated their inpatient episode as "excellent" indicated problems on 10\% of the issues measured on the Picker questionnaire. {DISCUSSION}: The evidence suggests that patient satisfaction scores present a limited and optimistic picture. Detailed questions about specific aspects of patients' experiences are likely to be more useful for monitoring the performance of various hospital departments and wards and could point to ways in which delivery of health care could be improved.},

We used functional {MRI} to investigate the neural basis by which an interruption is more disruptive to working memory performance in older individuals. Younger and older adults engaged in delayed recognition tasks both with and without interruption by a secondary task. Behavioral analysis revealed that working memory performance was more impaired by interruptions in older compared with younger adults. Functional connectivity analyses showed that when interrupted, older adults disengaged from a memory maintenance network and reallocated attentional resources toward the interrupting stimulus in a manner consistent with younger adults. However, unlike younger individuals, older adults failed to both disengage from the interruption and reestablish functional connections associated with the disrupted memory network. These results suggest that multitasking leads to more significant working memory disruption in older adults because of an interruption recovery failure, manifest as a deficient ability to dynamically switch between functional brain networks.},

Seventy adults participated in a replication of Milgram's Experiment 5 up to the point at which they first heard the learner's verbal protest (150 volts). Because 79\% of Milgram's participants who went past this point continued to the end of the shock generator's range, reasonable estimates could be made about what the present participants would have done if allowed to continue. Obedience rates in the 2006 replication were only slightly lower than those Milgram found 45 years earlier. Contrary to expectation, participants who saw a confederate refuse the experimenter's instructions obeyed as often as those who saw no model. Men and women did not differ in their rates of obedience, but there was some evidence that individual differences in empathic concern and desire for control affected participants' responses.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Obesity is a leading health threat. Determination of optimal therapies for long-term weight loss remains a challenge. Evidence suggests that successful weight loss depends on the compliance of weight loss program participants with their weight loss efforts. Despite this, little is known regarding the attributes influencing such compliance. The purpose of this study was to assess, using a discrete choice experiment ({DCE}), the relative importance of weight loss program attributes to its participants and to express these preferences in terms of their willingness to pay for them.

{RESEARCH} {METHODS}: A {DCE} survey explored the following weight loss program attributes in a sample of 165 overweight adults enrolled in community weight loss programs: cost, travel time required to attend, extent of physician involvement (e.g., none, monthly, every 2 weeks), components (e.g., diet, exercise, behavior change) emphasized, and focus (e.g., group, individual). The rate at which participants were willing to trade among attributes and the willingness to pay for different configurations of combined attributes were estimated using regression modeling.

{RESULTS}: All attributes investigated appeared to be statistically significant. The most important unit change was "program components emphasized" (e.g., moving from diet only to diet and exercise).

{DISCUSSION}: The majority of participants were willing to pay for weight loss programs that reflected their preferences. The {DCE} tool was useful in quantifying and understanding individual preferences in obesity management and provided information that could help to maximize the efficiency of existing weight loss programs or the design of new programs.},

	abstract = {A regional Swedish hospital has been the site of a quality improvement program that focuses on patient satisfaction, staff work environment and quality of hospital services. This article describes the study component that measures patients' views of the quality of care. The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable and valid instrument, to determine the predictors of patients' ratings of quality and to measure patient satisfaction at two points in time to determine whether patient ratings change following a quality improvement initiative. The instrument developed in this study was designed to assess patients' perceptions of the quality of hospital services, staff work environment and overall satisfaction for the purpose of providing feedback to hospital staff. This information would be used for quality improvement efforts within the hospital. Unique to this instrument are questions regarding patients' perceptions of the hospital staff work environment. The results revealed that the questionnaire demonstrated valid and reliable properties. The significant predictors of quality ratings were information concerning one's illness, and perceptions of the staff work environment. Patient satisfaction was measured and then reassessed following the implementation of various department-based improvement programs. The reassessment revealed significantly higher patient ratings in most areas. An intrinsic aspect of this quality program was the engagement of, and feedback process to, hospital personnel. Questionnaire results were reported graphically to hospital management and staff, thus serving as a catalyst for improvement.},

Die Theorie und das Konzept der Scham als Affekt, das in der klassischen Psychoanalyse verankert ist, wird dabei im Lichte der modernen Intersubjektivitätstheorie und -Forschung entworfen. Aus dieser intersubjektiven Sichtweise heraus besteht die Hauptthese darin, dass Scham in erster Linie als ein intersubjektives Geschehen zu konzeptuallisieren ist, nicht als intrasubjektives Geschehen. Dies wird auch durch eine besondere Eigenschaft der Scham, ihre ansteckende Natur deutlich. Was die Verortung der Scham angeht, wird postuliert, dass Scham als Affekt nicht einfach im Selbst eines Menschen wurzelt, d.h. subjektive Bedeutung besitzt. Scham geht auch nicht primär nur aus inneren Motiven (v.a. exhibitionistischen Motiven) hervor, sondern muss als ein Relikt einer interpersonalen Situation der Beschämung und Demütigung angesehen werden, als Erleben fehlender intersubjektiver Anerkennung. Diese wird als Zurückweisung, Missachtung und im schlimmsten Fall als Verworfensein und Ausgestoßensein empfunden und erlitten. Der abwertende, verachtende oder nicht resonierende Blick ist die entscheidende Komponente dabei.},

Consequently, well-validated satisfaction scales are rare. In order to respond to methodological requirements being associated with the measurement of patient satisfaction, the Munich Patient Satisfaction Scale ({MPSS}-24) was developed for psychiatric in-patients. The scale was validated on the basis of three independent samples (n=85, n= 161, n=91), and the effects of moderating variables were controlled. In several steps of item selection the initial pool of 133 items was reduced to 24 items, which were subjected to factor analysis. The {MPSS}-24 demonstrates one major principal component with two minor factors which indicates that doctor-patient communication is the essential source for patient satisfaction. The instrument is of high internal consistency and reliability, and convergent validity is satisfactory.},

	abstract = {In this work, we address an important but unexplored topic, namely the neural correlates of hate. In a block-design {fMRI} study, we scanned 17 normal human subjects while they viewed the face of a person they hated and also faces of acquaintances for whom they had neutral feelings. A hate score was obtained for the object of hate for each subject and this was used as a covariate in a between-subject random effects analysis. Viewing a hated face resulted in increased activity in the medial frontal gyrus, right putamen, bilaterally in premotor cortex, in the frontal pole and bilaterally in the medial insula. We also found three areas where activation correlated linearly with the declared level of hatred, the right insula, right premotor cortex and the right fronto-medial gyrus. One area of deactivation was found in the right superior frontal gyrus. The study thus shows that there is a unique pattern of activity in the brain in the context of hate. Though distinct from the pattern of activity that correlates with romantic love, this pattern nevertheless shares two areas with the latter, namely the putamen and the insula.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been notable interest in additive models of sensory integration. Binaural additivity has emerged as a main hypothesis in the loudness-scaling literature and has recently been asserted by authors using an axiomatic approach to psychophysics. Restrictions of the range of stimuli used in the majority of former experiments, and inherent weaknesses of the axiomatic study by Levelt, Riemersma, and Bunt (1972) are discussed as providing reasons for the present investigation. A limited binaural additivity ({LBA}) model is proposed that assumes contralateral binaural inhibition for interaural intensity differences that exceed a critical level. Experimental data are reported for 12 subjects in a loudness-matching task designed to test the axioms of cancellation and of commutativity, both necessary to the existence of strict binaural additivity. In a 2 X 2 design, frequencies of 200 Hz and 2 {kHz} were used, and mean intensity levels were 20 {dB} apart. Additivity was found violated in 33 out of 48 possible tests. The {LBA} model is shown to predict the systematic nonadditivity in the loudness judgments and to conform to results from other studies.},

Our analysis of data from the popular Web site {HOTorNOT}.com suggests that this is not the case: Less attractive people do not delude themselves into thinking that their dates are more physically attractive than others perceive them to be. Furthermore, the results also show that males, compared with females, are less affected by their own attractiveness when choosing whom to date.},

	abstract = {In this meta-analysis, we give a comprehensive overview of the effects of meditation on psychological variables that can be extracted from empirical studies, concentrating on the effects of meditation on nonclinical groups of adult meditators. Mostly because of methodological problems, almost ¾ of an initially identified 595 studies had to be excluded. Most studies appear to have been conducted without sufficient theoretical background. To put the results into perspective, we briefly summarize the major theoretical approaches from both East and West. The 163 studies that allowed the calculation of effect sizes exhibited medium average effects (r = .28 for all studies and r = .27 for the n = 125 studies from reviewed journals), which cannot be explained by mere relaxation or cognitive restructuring effects. In general, results were strongest (medium to large) for changes in emotionality and relationship issues, less strong (about medium) for measures of attention, and weakest (small to medium) for more cognitive measures. However, specific findings varied across different approaches to meditation (transcendental meditation, mindfulness meditation, and other meditation techniques). Surprisingly, meditation experience only partially covaried with long-term impact on the variables examined. In general, the dependent variables used cover only some of the content areas about which predictions can be made from already existing theories about meditation; still, such predictions lack precision at present. We conclude that to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of why and how meditation works, emphasis should be placed on the development of more precise theories and measurement devices.},

	abstract = {Problem-based learning ({PBL}) is perhaps the most innovative instructional method conceived in the his- tory of education. {PBL} was originally designed to respond to the criticism that traditional teaching and learning methods fail to prepare medical students for solving problems in clinical settings. Instead of requir- ing that students study content knowledge and then practice context-free problems, {PBL} embeds students' learning processes in real-life problems. After its suc- cessful implementation in various fields of medical education, {PBL} is now being implemented throughout higher education as well as in K--12 education. The purpose of this chapter is to inform researchers and practitioners about research findings and issues in {PBL} that may be used to inform future studies. In this chap- ter, we review {PBL} research from the past 30 years. We first describe the history of development and imple- mentation of {PBL} in various educational settings and define the major characteristics of {PBL}. We then review the research on {PBL}. First, we examine the effective- ness of {PBL} in terms of student learning outcomes, including basic domain knowledge acquisition and applications, retention of content and problem-solving skills, higher order thinking, self-directed learning/life- long learning, and self-perception. Second, we look at implementation issues, such as tutoring issues, curric- ulum design issues, and use of technology. Finally, we provide recommendations for future research.},

A literature search was undertaken using four electronic databases and references of retrieved articles. The search included articles written in English published up to December 2011. Quality of included trials was assessed. In total, 24 studies were included, three of which were based on secondary analyses of previously investigated samples. Current evidence suggests that {MBIs} can reduce the consumption of several substances including alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, cigarettes, and opiates to a significantly greater extent than waitlist controls, non-specific educational support groups, and some specific control groups. Some preliminary evidence also suggests that {MBIs} are associated with a reduction in craving as well as increased mindfulness. The limited generalizability of the reviewed findings is noted (i.e., small sample size, lack of methodological details, and the lack of consistently replicated findings). More rigorous and larger randomized controlled studies are warranted.},

Its aim was to test the quantitative component of Coombs's (1964) theory via an empirical application to subjective control in gambling behavior (Dickerson and Baron, 2000). It was found that approximately 96\% of judgments upon bilateral stimulus pairs were as predicted by the theory of unidimensional unfolding. The double cancellation axiom of the theory of axiomatic conjoint measurement ({ACM}) (Krantz, Luce, Suppes and Tversky, 1971) was satisfied by the interstimulus midpoint order obtained from these judgments. These results supported previous unfolding studies on attitudes (Johnson, 2001; Michell, 1994). Exponential and linear relationships were found between the transformed scaling solutions of Coombs's (1964) theory and the {SHCMpp} (Andrich, 1995). The implications of these results were discussed. Additionally, the article presented both a formal theory of item construction (Michell, 1994) and an accessible demonstration of the Goode's algorithm scaling procedure.},

	abstract = {Background Articles whose authors have supplemented subscription-based access to the publisher's version by self-archiving their own final draft to make it accessible free for all on the web (“Open Access”, {OA}) are cited significantly more than articles in the same journal and year that have not been made {OA}. Some have suggested that this “{OA} Advantage” may not be causal but just a self-selection bias, because authors preferentially make higher-quality articles {OA}. To test this we compared self-selective self-archiving with mandatory self-archiving for a sample of 27,197 articles published 2002--2006 in 1,984 journals. Methdology/Principal Findings The {OA} Advantage proved just as high for both. Logistic regression analysis showed that the advantage is independent of other correlates of citations (article age; journal impact factor; number of co-authors, references or pages; field; article type; or country) and highest for the most highly cited articles. The {OA} Advantage is real, independent and causal, but skewed. Its size is indeed correlated with quality, just as citations themselves are (the top 20\% of articles receive about 80\% of all citations). Conclusions/Significance The {OA} advantage is greater for the more citable articles, not because of a quality bias from authors self-selecting what to make {OA}, but because of a quality advantage, from users self-selecting what to use and cite, freed by {OA} from the constraints of selective accessibility to subscribers only. It is hoped that these findings will help motivate the adoption of {OA} self-archiving mandates by universities, research institutions and research funders.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}: Dialectical behavior therapy ({DBT}) is a treatment for suicidal behavior and borderline personality disorder with well-documented efficacy.

{OBJECTIVE}: To evaluate the hypothesis that unique aspects of {DBT} are more efficacious compared with treatment offered by non-behavioral psychotherapy experts.

{DESIGN}: One-year randomized controlled trial, plus 1 year of posttreatment follow-up.

{SETTING}: University outpatient clinic and community practice.

{PARTICIPANTS}: One hundred one clinically referred women with recent suicidal and self-injurious behaviors meeting {DSM}-{IV} criteria, matched to condition on age, suicide attempt history, negative prognostic indication, and number of lifetime intentional self-injuries and psychiatric hospitalizations.

{INTERVENTION}: One year of {DBT} or 1 year of community treatment by experts (developed to maximize internal validity by controlling for therapist sex, availability, expertise, allegiance, training and experience, consultation availability, and institutional prestige).

{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Trimester assessments of suicidal behaviors, emergency services use, and general psychological functioning. Measures were selected based on previous outcome studies of {DBT}. Outcome variables were evaluated by blinded assessors.

{RESULTS}: Dialectical behavior therapy was associated with better outcomes in the intent-to-treat analysis than community treatment by experts in most target areas during the 2-year treatment and follow-up period. Subjects receiving {DBT} were half as likely to make a suicide attempt (hazard ratio, 2.66; P = .005), required less hospitalization for suicide ideation (F(1,92) = 7.3; P = .004), and had lower medical risk (F(1,50) = 3.2; P = .04) across all suicide attempts and self-injurious acts combined. Subjects receiving {DBT} were less likely to drop out of treatment (hazard ratio, 3.2; P {\textless} .001) and had fewer psychiatric hospitalizations (F(1,92) = 6.0; P = .007) and psychiatric emergency department visits (F(1,92) = 2.9; P = .04).

{CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings replicate those of previous studies of {DBT} and suggest that the effectiveness of {DBT} cannot reasonably be attributed to general factors associated with expert psychotherapy. Dialectical behavior therapy appears to be uniquely effective in reducing suicide attempts.},

The relationship between computer anxiety and career satisfaction and job stress were empirically examined in this study. Two hundred and thirty undergraduate students (125 female and 105 male students) at a university in south-western part of Louisiana completed computer anxiety, computer attitude, job satisfaction, career satisfaction and stress surveys. Hierarchical moderated regression results support that the attitude towards computer acts as a moderator in the relationship between (i) computer anxiety and stress, (ii) computer anxiety and job satisfaction, and (iii) computer anxiety and career satisfaction.

Participants in the study consisted of 481 21-22-year-old men and women who are part of an ongoing longitudinal study. Psychopathy was assessed by the degree of similarity between an individual's {NEO}-{PI}-R and an expert-generated {FFM} psychopathy prototype. The expert-based prototype supported the account of Widiger and Lynam (1998), as did the correlations between the {NEO}-{PI}-R Psychopathy Resemblance Index ({PRI}) and the individual personality dimensions. The {PRI} was also related in predicted ways to measures of antisocial behavior, drug use, and psychopathology. The results support the contention that psychopathy can be understood as an extreme variant of common dimensions of personality, and underscore the utility of a dimensional model of personality disorders.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The aim of this study was to adapt and validate an instrument for assessing quality of care from the patients' perspective in the context of Chilean primary care. {METHODS}: The 'Health Centre Assessment Questionnaire' is made up of six multiple-item scales and two single-item scales addressing eight key areas of primary care activity. A further two single-item scales ask about the overall satisfaction and the way in which the centre deals with patients' health issues. The adaptation process was developed according to methods described in the specialized literature. The instrument was initially pre-tested in a sample of 100 primary care patients. The validation was carried out in 10 urban public primary healthcare centres where 2896 patients were invited to complete the questionnaire. The validity and reliability of the instrument was assessed using standard psychometric techniques. {RESULTS}: Ninety nine per cent (2870) of those approached completed the questionnaire. It was acceptable to most of the patients as reflected by the high response rate, and a full range of possible scores in most of the scales. Reliability was good as reflected by high internal consistency and homogeneity. Validity was supported by the confirmation of scaling assumptions, the moderate correlations between multiple-item scales, and by the confirmation of our 'a priori' hypothesis. {CONCLUSIONS}: The questionnaire could be a useful instrument for assessing a number of important dimensions in Chilean primary care. It is acceptable, reliable and valid. Further work is required to evaluate its validity against external criteria and its test-retest reliability.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The aim was to translate, revise, and standardize the Perceived Stress Questionnaire ({PSQ}) by Levenstein et al. (1993) in German. The instrument assesses subjectively experienced stress independent of a specific and objective occasion.

{METHODS}: Exploratory factor analyses and a revision of the scale content were carried out on a sample of 650 subjects (Psychosomatic Medicine patients, women after delivery, women after miscarriage, and students). Confirmatory analyses and examination of structural stability across subgroups were carried out on a second sample of 1,808 subjects (psychosomatic, tinnitus, inflammatory bowel disease patients, pregnant women, healthy adults) using linear structural equation modeling and multisample analyses. External validation included immunological measures in women who had suffered a miscarriage.

{RESULTS}: Four factors (worries, tension, joy, demands) emerged, with 5 items each, as compared with the 30 items of the original {PSQ}. The factor structure was confirmed on the second sample. Multisample analyses yielded a fair structural stability across groups. Reliability values were satisfactory. Findings suggest that three scales represent internal stress reactions, whereas the scale "demands" relates to perceived external stressors. Significant and meaningful differences between groups indicate differential validity. A higher degree of certain immunological imbalances after miscarriage (presumably linked to pregnancy loss) was found in those women who had a higher stress score. Sensitivity to change was demonstrated in two different treatment samples.

{CONCLUSION}: We propose the revised {PSQ} as a valid and economic tool for stress research. The overall score permits comparison with results from earlier studies using the original instrument.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Alterations of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) function are well-established in adults with current depression. {HPA} alterations may persist into remission and confer increased risk for recurrence.

{METHODS}: A modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test ({TSST}) was administered at baseline to 32 young adults with remitted major depressive disorder and 36 never-depressed controls. Participants were randomly assigned to either a 'high-stress' condition involving social evaluation or a 'low-stress' control condition. Cortisol concentrations were measured in saliva samples throughout the {TSST}. Participants were assessed again after 6 months for the occurrence of stressful life events and depressive symptoms/disorders during the follow-up period.

{RESULTS}: Participants who exhibited enhanced cortisol reactivity in the low-stress condition showed increases in depressive symptoms over follow-up, after controlling for stressful life events during the follow-up period. Anticipatory stress cortisol and cortisol reactivity each interacted with history of depressive episodes to predict depression trajectories.

{LIMITATIONS}: The single {TSST} administration limits conclusions about whether alterations of cortisol reactivity represent trait-like vulnerability factors or consequences ("scars') of past depression.

{CONCLUSIONS}: These results extend previous findings on stress sensitivity in depression and suggest that altered {HPA} function during remission could reflect an endophenotype for vulnerability to depression recurrence. Findings support interactive models of risk for depression recurrence implicating {HPA} function, depression history, and sensitivity to minor stressors. Results may have implications for interventions that match treatment approaches to profiles of {HPA} function.},

	abstract = {Hallucinogenic psilocybin is known to alter the subjective experience of time. However, there is no study that systematically investigated objective measures of time perception under psilocybin. Therefore, we studied dose-dependent effects of the serotonin (5-{HT})2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine) on temporal processing, employing tasks of temporal reproduction, sensorimotor synchronization and tapping tempo. To control for cognitive and subjective changes, we assessed spatial working memory and conscious experience. Twelve healthy human volunteers were tested under placebo, medium (115 microg/kg), and high (250 microg/kg) dose conditions, in a double-blind experimental design. Psilocybin was found to significantly impair subjects' ability to (1) reproduce interval durations longer than 2.5 sec, (2) to synchronize to inter-beat intervals longer than 2 sec and (3) caused subjects to be slower in their preferred tapping rate. These objective effects on timing performance were accompanied by working-memory deficits and subjective changes in conscious state, namely increased reports of 'depersonalization' and 'derealization' phenomena including disturbances in subjective 'time sense.' Our study is the first to systematically assess the impact of psilocybin on timing performance on standardized measures of temporal processing. Results indicate that the serotonin system is selectively involved in duration processing of intervals longer than 2 to 3 seconds and in the voluntary control of the speed of movement. We speculate that psilocybin's selective disruption of longer intervals is likely to be a product of interactions with cognitive dimensions of temporal processing -presumably via 5-{HT}2A receptor stimulation.},

Latent trait structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the impact of the intervention program on changes in constructs of teens' attitudes toward sexuality.

Various aspects of study design are discussed in this article.: Six essential considerations in the planning and evaluation of medical research studies are presented and discussed in the light of selected scientific articles from the international literature as well as the authors' own scientific expertise with regard to study design.: The six main considerations for study design are the question to be answered, the study population, the unit of analysis, the type of study, the measuring technique, and the calculation of sample size.: This article is intended to give the reader guidance in evaluating the design of studies in medical research. This should enable the reader to categorize medical studies better and to assess their scientific quality more accurately.},

As both a once-factorial (mindfulness as a generic construct) and a two-factorial solution (mindfulness comprised of the two subcomponents presence and acceptance) have been suggested, this study compares the psychometric properties of both models. Results corroborated the psychometric qualities of the instrument with the exception of one item and suggest that the two- factor solution is more desirable from a psychometric point of view. However, there is evidence for bottom and ceiling effects that may blur measurement in individuals extremely high and low in mindfulness.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Evidence-based medicine is valuable to the extent that the evidence base is complete and unbiased. Selective publication of clinical trials--and the outcomes within those trials--can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent risk-benefit ratio.

{METHODS}: We obtained reviews from the Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) for studies of 12 antidepressant agents involving 12,564 patients. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify matching publications. For trials that were reported in the literature, we compared the published outcomes with the {FDA} outcomes. We also compared the effect size derived from the published reports with the effect size derived from the entire {FDA} data set.

{RESULTS}: Among 74 {FDA}-registered studies, 31\%, accounting for 3449 study participants, were not published. Whether and how the studies were published were associated with the study outcome. A total of 37 studies viewed by the {FDA} as having positive results were published; 1 study viewed as positive was not published. Studies viewed by the {FDA} as having negative or questionable results were, with 3 exceptions, either not published (22 studies) or published in a way that, in our opinion, conveyed a positive outcome (11 studies). According to the published literature, it appeared that 94\% of the trials conducted were positive. By contrast, the {FDA} analysis showed that 51\% were positive. Separate meta-analyses of the {FDA} and journal data sets showed that the increase in effect size ranged from 11 to 69\% for individual drugs and was 32\% overall.

{CONCLUSIONS}: We cannot determine whether the bias observed resulted from a failure to submit manuscripts on the part of authors and sponsors, from decisions by journal editors and reviewers not to publish, or both. Selective reporting of clinical trial results may have adverse consequences for researchers, study participants, health care professionals, and patients.},

The question asked in this work is whether a threat of disappearance changes the way people value such options. In four experiments using “door games,” we demonstrate that options that threaten to disappear cause decision makers to invest more effort and money in keeping these options open, even when the options themselves seem to be of little interest. This general tendency is shown to be resilient to information about the outcomes, to increased experience, and to the saliency of the cost. The last experiment provides initial evidence that the mechanism underlying the tendency to keep doors open is a type of aversion to loss rather than a desire for flexibility.},

Such a measure has the potential to guide quality improvement initiatives related to continuity of care. {OBJECTIVE}: Our objective was to develop and examine the psychometric properties of a measure that would meet this need, the Patient Continuity of Care Questionnaire ({PCCQ}). {METHOD}: The {PCCQ} was administered to 204 inpatients 4 weeks after discharge. The questionnaire was assessed by item and principal components analysis. Factors derived from principal components analysis were assessed for internal consistency and construct validity. {RESULTS}: A principal components analysis resulted in six subscales including perceptions of: (1) relationships with providers in hospital, (2) information transfer to patients, (3) relationships with providers in community, (4) management of written forms, (5) management of follow-up and (6) management of communication among providers. These subscales were internally consistent in our sample and demonstrated construct validity through correlations with other related constructs. {CONCLUSION}: This initial study supports the reliability and validity of the {PCCQ} for measuring patient perceptions of factors central to continuity of care. The questionnaire subscales correspond to the theoretical components of continuity of care that have been proposed in the literature, namely informational, relational and management continuity. The subscales may be of value for identifying problems in continuity of care and for evaluating interventions aimed at improving continuity of care for patients after hospital discharge.},

Through this special issue on Green {HRM}, we seek to stimulate the field of {HRM} to expand its role in the pursuit of environmentally sustainable business. In this introduction to the special issue, we first provide an overview of the articles that appear in the special issue. Next we present a detailed discussion of research questions that arise from a consideration of several functional {HRM} practices, including performance management; training, development, and learning; compensation and rewards; and organizational culture. We conclude by describ- ing opportunities for research at the intersection of strategic {HRM} and environmental man- agement.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The objective of this study was to identify specific patient satisfaction items related to overall satisfaction by different length of stay ({LOS}) for patients in Japanese hospital settings. {METHODS}: This cross-sectional study involved a participant sample, drawn from 77 voluntarily participating hospitals throughout Japan, of in-patients discharged to the community. Older patients and psychiatric, pediatric, obstetric and gynecologic patients were excluded. The 1050 respondents analyzed (response rate {\textgreater} or = 5l.1\%) were divided into three groups based on their {LOS}: group 1, {LOS} {\textless} or = 1 week; group 2, {LOS} {\textless} or = 1 month; and group 3, {LOS} {\textgreater} 1 month. Using stepwise multiple regression analysis, we explored for each {LOS} group the relationship between overall patient satisfaction and satisfaction with 33 individual items, including three regarding perceived reputation of the hospital in question. {RESULTS}: Some unique satisfaction items for each group (e.g. 'skill of nursing care' in group 1, 'Recovery of physical health', 'skill of nursing care', and 'respect for patients opinions and feelings' in group 2, and 'relief from pain' and 'respect for patients' opinions and feelings' in group 3) were significantly associated with overall satisfaction. In all three groups, common items (e.g. 'recovery from distress and anxiety' and 'doctor's clinical competence') also related significantly to overall satisfaction. Two items pertaining to the hospital reputation dimension (e.g. 'family member's evaluation of the hospital' and 'hospital reputation among other patients') were also significant predictors of overall satisfaction in all three groups. {CONCLUSION}: The findings show that according to {LOS}, unique items could determine significantly the achievement of overall satisfaction, while some common predictors across all three {LOS} groupings also seemed to be indispensable for inpatient's assessment of hospital care. It was also confirmed in this study that a positive perception of hospital reputation might have an important role in patient satisfaction in Japan.},

The psychophysics of value induce risk aversion in the domain of gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses. The psychophysics of chance induce overweighting of sure things and of improbable events, relative to events of moderate probability. Decision problems can be described or framed in multiple ways that give rise to different preferences, contrary to the invariance criterion of rational choice. The process of mental accounting, in which people organize the outcomes of transactions, explains some anomalies of consumer behavior. In particular, the acceptability of an option can depend on whether a negative outcome is evaluated as a cost or as an uncompensated loss. The relationships between decision values and experience values and between hedonic experience and objective states are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ({MBTI}; Myers \& {McCaulley}, 1985) was evaluated from the perspectives of Jung's theory of psychological types and the five-factor model of personality as measured by self-reports and peer ratings on the {NEO} Personality Inventory ({NEO}-{PI}; Costa \& {McCrae}, 1985b). Data were provided by 267 men and 201 women ages 19 to 93. Consistent with earlier research and evaluations, there was no support for the view that the {MBTI} measures truly dichotomous preferences or qualitatively distinct types; instead, the instrument measures four relatively independent dimensions. The interpretation of the Judging-Perceiving index was also called into question. The data suggest that Jung's theory is either incorrect or inadequately operationalized by the {MBTI} and cannot provide a sound basis for interpreting it. However, correlational analyses showed that the four {MBTI} indices did measure aspects of four of the five major dimensions of normal personality. The five-factor model provides an alternative basis for interpreting {MBTI} findings within a broader, more commonly shared conceptual framework.},

Hoffrage's (1995) ecological framework, the authors wrote a computerized tutorial program to train people to construct frequency representations (representation training) rather than to insert probabilities into Bayes's rule (rule training). Bayesian computations are simpler to perform with natural frequencies than with probabilities, and there are evolutionary reasons for assuming that cognitive algorithms have been developed to deal with natural frequencies. In 2 studies, the authors compared representation training with rule training; the criteria were an immediate learning effect, transfer to new problems, and long-term temporal stability. Rule training was as good in transfer as representation training, but representation training had a higher immediate learning effect and greater temporal stability.},

In this study, we examined the efficacy of using reparative impression management tactics to mitigate integrity concerns associated with a perilous stigma. Drawing on affect control theory, we proposed that the use of 3 impression management tactics---apology, justification, excuse---would differentially affect hiring evaluations through their influence on perceived remorse and anticipated workplace deviance. Across 3 studies, we found support for our proposed model. Our results revealed the use of an apology or justification tactic when explaining a previous criminal offense had a positive indirect effect on hiring evaluations, whereas the use of an excuse tactic had a negative indirect effect. These findings suggest applicants may benefit from using impression management tactics that communicate remorse when discussing events or associations that violate integrity expectations.

	abstract = {Much research in the last two decades has demonstrated that human responses deviate from the performance deemed normative according to various models of decision making and rational judgment (e.g., the basic axioms of utility theory). This gap between the normative and the descriptive can be interpreted as indicating systematic irrationalities in human cognition. However, four alternative interpretations preserve the assumption that human behavior and cognition is largely rational. These posit that the gap is due to (1) performance errors, (2) computational limitations, (3) the wrong norm being applied by the experimenter, and (4) a different construal of the task by the subject. In the debates about the viability of these alternative explanations, attention has been focused too narrowly on the model response. In a series of experiments involving most of the classic tasks in the heuristics and biases literature, we have examined the implications of individual differences in performance for each of the four explanations of the normative/descriptive gap. Performance errors are a minor factor in the gap; computational limitations underlie non-normative responding on several tasks, particularly those that involve some type of cognitive decontextualization. Unexpected patterns of covariance can suggest when the wrong norm is being applied to a task or when an alternative construal of the task should be considered appropriate.},

{BACKGROUND}: Although increasingly popular, systematic review has engendered a critique of the claims made for it as a more objective method for summing up research findings than other kinds of reviews.

{DISCUSSION}: An alternative understanding of systematic review is as a highly subjective, albeit disciplined, engagement between resisting readers and resistant texts. Reviewers of research exemplify the resisting reader when they exclude reports on grounds of relevance, quality, or methodological difference. Research reports exemplify resistant texts as they do not simply yield their findings, but rather must be made docile to review. These acts of resistance make systematic review possible, but challenge claims of its greater capacity to control bias.

{CONCLUSION}: An understanding of the reading and writing practices that define systematic review still holds truth and objectivity as regulative ideals, but is aware of the reading and writing practices that both enable and challenge those ideals.},

	abstract = {Our ability to generate and collect data has been increasing rapidly. Not only are all of our business, scientific, and government transactions now computerized, but the widespread use of digital cameras, publication tools, and bar codes also generate data. On the collection side, scanned text and image platforms, satellite remote sensing systems, and the World Wide Web have flooded us with a tremendous amount of data. This explosive growth has generated an even more urgent need for new techniques and automated tools that can help us transform this data into useful information and knowledge. Like the first edition, voted the most popular data mining book by {KD} Nuggets readers, this book explores concepts and techniques for the discovery of patterns hidden in large data sets, focusing on issues relating to their feasibility, usefulness, effectiveness, and scalability. However, since the publication of the first edition, great progress has been made in the development of new data mining methods, systems, and applications. This new edition substantially enhances the first edition, and new chapters have been added to address recent developments on mining complex types of data- including stream data, sequence data, graph structured data, social network data, and multi-relational data. Whether you are a seasoned professional or a new student of data mining, this book has much to offer you: A comprehensive, practical look at the concepts and techniques you need to know to get the most out of real business data. Updates that incorporate input from readers, changes in the field, and more material on statistics and machine learning. Dozens of algorithms and implementation examples, all in easily understood pseudo-code and suitable for use in real-world, large-scale data mining projects.

Given that these measures may not accurately reflect physiological conditions, there is a need for an objective marker of improvement in research evaluating the beneficial effects of stress management programs. Cortisol is the major stress hormone in the human organism and as such is a promising candidate measure in the study of the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programs. In conjunction with other biological measures, the use of cortisol levels as a physiological marker of stress may be useful to validate self-reported benefits attributed to this program. In the current manuscript, we review the available literature on the role of cortisol as a physiological marker for improvement with regards to mindfulness practice, and make recommendations for future study designs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Kyngdon's response is of particular interest, since he asserts that measurement may already have been established. If correct, it would definitely invalidate any quantity objection and end the century-long discussion about the measurability of psychological attributes. Therefore the focus of the rejoinder will be on the question of when measurement is reached. First the meaning of measurement is elaborated. On this basis, criteria for the successful establishment of measurement are formulated and it is outlined how these are satisfied in the case of intensive quantities. It is concluded that the evidence presented by Kyngdon is insufficient and inadequate. The approach will also serve as background to discuss objections raised against the Millean Quantity Objection.},

It was trialed and modified to ensure sensitive measurement of key attributes of discharge planning process and outcome. This paper explores the patient and carer versions of {PREPARED}. Data items were reduced to domains of key questions by factor analysis. Instrument performance was assessed by correlation of process and outcome measures, by comparing {PREPARED} responses with subsequent unstructured interview data, and by testing whether {PREPARED} responses were independent of health-related quality of life at the time of survey. {RESULTS}: Four key process domains were identified: information exchange (community services and equipment), medication management, preparation for coping after discharge and control of discharge circumstances. Outcome was measured as overall satisfaction with discharge, whether equipment and community service needs had been met, use of health services and health related costs post-discharge. The instrument performed well when compared with interview data, the process and outcome domains were largely independent of each other, as were responses to {PREPARED} and {SF}-36. {CONCLUSIONS}: {PREPARED} offers a comprehensive way of closing the quality improvement loop, by providing information from the community perspective on the quality of planning for discharge from the acute hospital setting.},

	abstract = {1. Recent technical and methodological advances have led to a dramatic increase in the use of spectrometry to quantify reflectance properties of biological materials, as well asmodels to determine how these colours are per- ceived by animals, providing important insights into ecological and evolutionary aspects of animal visual com- munication. 2. Despite this growing interest, a unified cross-platform framework for analysing and visualizing spectral data has not been available. We introduce pavo, an R package that facilitates the organization, visualization and analysis of spectral data in a cohesive framework. pavo is highly flexible, allowing users to (a) organize and manipulate data from a variety of sources, (b) visualize data using R's state-of-the-art graphics capabilities and (c) analyse data using spectral curve shape properties and visual systemmodelling for a broad range of taxa. 3. In this paper, we present a summary of the functions implemented in pavo and how they integrate in a work- flow to explore and analyse spectral data.We also present an exact solution for the calculation of colour volume overlap in colourspace, thus expanding previously publishedmethodologies. 4. As an example of pavo's capabilities, we compare the colour patterns of three African glossy starling species, two of which have diverged very recently. We demonstrate how both colour vision models and direct spectral measurement analysis can be used to describe colour attributes and differences between these species. Different approaches to visual models and several plotting capabilities exemplify the package's versatility and streamlined workflow. 5. pavo provides a cohesive environment for handling spectral data and addressing complex sensory ecology questions, while {integratingwithR}'s modular core for a broader and comprehensive analytical framework, automated management of spectral data and reproducibleworkflows for colour analysis.},

Studies suggest improvements in general aspects of well-being, including quality of life ({QoL}), coping and positive affect, as well as decreased anxiety and depression.

{METHODS}: A quasi-experimental study examined effects of an 8-week {MBSR} intervention among 58 female patients with fibromyalgia (mean, 52 +/- 8 years) who underwent {MBSR} or an active social support procedure. Participants were assigned to groups by date of entry, and 6 subjects dropped out during the study. Self-report measures were validated German inventories and included the following scales: visual analog pain, pain perception, coping with pain, a symptom checklist and {QoL}. Pre- and postintervention measurements were made. Additionally, a 3-year follow-up was carried out on a subgroup of 26 participants.

{RESULTS}: Pre- to postintervention analyses indicated {MBSR} to provide significantly greater benefits than the control intervention on most dimensions, including visual analog pain, {QoL} subscales, coping with pain, anxiety, depression and somatic complaints (Cohen d effect size, 0.40-1.10). Three-year follow-up analyses of {MBSR} participants indicated sustained benefits for these same measures (effect size, 0.50-0.65).

{CONCLUSIONS}: Based upon a quasi-randomized trial and long-term observational follow-up, results indicate mindfulness intervention to be of potential long-term benefit for female fibromyalgia patients.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This study aims to investigate the evidence of the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction ({MBSR}) in improving stress, depression and anxiety in breast cancer patients.

{METHODS}: An extensive systematic electronic review ({PubMed}, Embase, {CINAHL}, {PsyArticles}, {PsycINFO}, Scopus, Ovid, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library) and a hand search were carried out from 15 October 2011 to 30 November 2011 to retrieve relevant articles using 'mindfulness' or 'mindfulness-based stress reduction' and 'breast cancer' as keywords. Information about the baseline characteristics of the participants, interventions and findings on perceived stress, depression and anxiety was extracted from each study.

{RESULTS}: Nine published studies (two randomised controlled trials, one quasi-experimental case-control study and six one-group, pre-intervention and post-intervention studies) up to November 2011 that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were analysed. The pooled effect size (95\% {CI}) for {MBSR} on stress was 0.710 (0.511-0.909), on depression was 0.575 (0.429-0.722) and on anxiety was 0.733 (0.450-1.017).

{CONCLUSION}: On the basis of these findings, {MBSR} shows a moderate to large positive effect size on the mental health of breast cancer patients and warrants further systematic investigation because it has a potential to make a significant improvement on mental health for women in this group.},

	abstract = {Social media have been adopted by many businesses. More and more companies are using social media tools such as Facebook and Twitter to provide various services and interact with customers. As a result, a large amount of user-generated content is freely available on social media sites. To increase competitive advantage and effectively assess the competitive environment of businesses, companies need to monitor and analyze not only the customer-generated content on their own social media sites, but also the textual information on their competitors' social media sites. In an effort to help companies understand how to perform a social media competitive analysis and transform social media data into knowledge for decision makers and e-marketers, this paper describes an in-depth case study which applies text mining to analyze unstructured text content on Facebook and Twitter sites of the three largest pizza chains: Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza and Papa John's Pizza. The results reveal the value of social media competitive analysis and the power of text mining as an effective technique to extract business value from the vast amount of available social media data. Recommendations are also provided to help companies develop their social media competitive analysis strategy. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs--competence, autonomy, and relatedness--which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being.

	abstract = {The hypothesis of a Hierarchy of the Sciences with physical sciences at the top, social sciences at the bottom, and biological sciences in-between is nearly 200 years old. This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the "hardness" of scientific research--i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors--is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a "positive" (full or partial) or "negative" support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in "softer" sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree.},

Participants (N = 112) were divided into four groups (n = 28). They either exclusively studied 36 action phrases (e.g., "lift the glass") or both studied and cued-recalled them in four trials. During study trials participants encoded the action phrases either by motorically performing them, or by reading them aloud, and they took final verb-cued recall tests over 18-min and 1-week retention intervals. A testing effect was demonstrated for action phrases, however, only when they were verbally encoded, and not when they were enacted. Similarly, enactive (relative to verbal) encoding reduced the rate of forgetting, but only when the action phrases were exclusively studied, and not when they were also tested. These less-than-additive effects of enactment and testing on the rate of forgetting, as well as on long-term retention, support the notion that both study techniques effectively promote item-specific processing that can only be marginally increased further by combining them.},

We conducted a cross-sectional as well as a two-week-diary study with 35 dual-earner couples (N = 70 working adults, 51.3 \% married). Besides work-family conflict, we measured variables such as subjective involvement in the work and family domains, emotional well-being, and personal goals. Work-family conflicts were partly interdependent between the two partners: everyday conflicts due to negative influences of the partnership domain were positively interrelated. Work-family conflict were mainly predicted by psychological variables (e. g., subjective involvement in the professional domain), whereas sociodemographic parameters (e. g., gender) were of minor importance. Cross-sectionally as well as processually work-family conflicts were related to negative emotions. Positive emotions were mainly influenced by individual goal progress and by perceiving the partner as content and supportive.

This article reviews the empirical literature on the effects of mindfulness on psychological health. We begin with a discussion of the construct of mindfulness, differences between Buddhist and Western psychological conceptualizations of mindfulness, and how mindfulness has been integrated into Western medicine and psychology, before reviewing three areas of empirical research: cross-sectional, correlational research on the associations between mindfulness and various indicators of psychological health; intervention research on the effects of mindfulness-oriented interventions on psychological health; and laboratory-based, experimental research on the immediate effects of mindfulness inductions on emotional and behavioral functioning. We conclude that mindfulness brings about various positive psychological effects, including increased subjective well-being, reduced psychological symptoms and emotional reactivity, and improved behavioral regulation. The review ends with a discussion on mechanisms of change of mindfulness interventions and suggested directions for future research.},

No significant relationship was found between attractiveness and conviction/acquittal, although seriousness of the crime was found to correlate negatively with attractiveness (p {\textless}.01). Race of the defendant showed a systematic relationship to punishment, with nonwhites drawing consistently more severe sentences than whites; a multiple regression analysis using attractiveness, race, and seriousness of crime as predictors of punishment yielded results which implied that this finding was largely due to a confounding of race and seriousness of the crime.},

	abstract = {Sentiment Analysis ({SA}) is an ongoing field of research in text mining field. {SA} is the computational treatment of opinions, sentiments and subjectivity of text. This survey paper tackles a comprehensive overview of the last update in this field. Many recently proposed algorithms' enhancements and various {SA} applications are investigated and presented briefly in this survey. These articles are categorized according to their contributions in the various {SA} techniques. The related fields to {SA} (transfer learning, emotion detection, and building resources) that attracted researchers recently are discussed. The main target of this survey is to give nearly full image of {SA} techniques and the related fields with brief details. The main contributions of this paper include the sophisticated categorizations of a large number of recent articles and the illustration of the recent trend of research in the sentiment analysis and its related areas. © 2014.},

	abstract = {Generalized linear models provide a unified theoretical and conceptual framework for many of the most commonly used statistical methods. In the ten years since publication of the first edition of this bestselling text, great strides have been made in the development of new methods and in software for generalized linear models and other closely related models.Thoroughly revised and updated, An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models, Second Edition continues to initiate intermediate students of statistics, and the many other disciplines that use statistics, in the practical use of these models and methods. The new edition incorporates many of the important developments of the last decade, including survival analysis, nominal and ordinal logistic regression, generalized estimating equations, and multi-level models. It also includes modern methods for checking model adequacy and examples from an even wider range of application. Statistics can appear to the uninitiated as a collection of unrelated tools. An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models, Second Edition illustrates how these apparently disparate methods are examples or special cases of a conceptually simple structure based on the exponential family of distribution, maximum likelihood estimation, and the principles of statistical modelling.},

Although some prior literature has discussed these possibilities, their exact definitions and analytic procedures have not been completely articulated.

The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88\% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95\% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85\% of cases. For the personality trait “Openness,” prediction accuracy is close to the test--retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.},

The scoring systems, of which 18 were randomly generated by a computer, resulted in negligible error when comparing any assigned scoring system with any selected "true" scoring system. Errors are determined by the Pearsonian correlation coefficient (r) and r². The advantages of treating ordinal variables as interval are demonstrated with regard to the relation between occupational prestige and suicide. These advantages include: (1) the use of more powerful, sensitive, better developed and interpretable statistics with known sampling error, (2) the retention of more knowledge about the characteristics of the data, and (3) greater versatility in statistical manipulation (e.g., partial and multiple correlation and regression, analysis of variance and covariance, and most pictorial presentations). The computer approach to this problem does not exhaust all possibilities for assigning numbers, which partially limits the generality of the findings.},

The grandiose exhibitionism subscale of the narcissistic personality inventory was hypothesized to predict the self-promoting behaviors. The entitlement/exploitativeness subscale was hypothesized to predict the anti-social behaviors. Results were largely consistent with the hypothesis for the self-promoting behaviors but mixed concerning the anti-social behaviors.

Recent human neuroimaging and psychophysical studies suggest that rivalry entails competitive interactions at multiple neural sites, including sites that retain eye-selective information. Rivalry greatly suppresses activity in the ventral pathway and attenuates visual adaptation to form and motion; nonetheless, some information about the suppressed stimulus reaches higher brain areas. Although rivalry depends on low-level inhibitory interactions, high-level excitatory influences promoting perceptual grouping and selective attention can extend the local dominance of a stimulus over space and time. Inhibitory and excitatory circuits considered within a hybrid model might account for the paradoxical properties of binocular rivalry and provide insights into the neural bases of visual awareness itself.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Although abortion or termination of pregnancy ({TOP}) has become an increasingly normalized component of women's health care over the past forty years, insufficient attention has been paid to women's experiences of surgical or medical methods of {TOP}.

{OBJECTIVE}: To undertake a narrative review of qualitative studies of women's experiences of {TOP} and their perspectives on surgical or medical methods.

{METHODS}: Keyword searches of Medline, {CINAHL}, {ISI}, and {IBSS} databases. Manual searches of other relevant journals and reference lists of primary articles.

{RESULTS}: Qualitative studies (n = 18) on women's experiences of abortion were identified. Analysis of the results of studies reviewed revealed three main themes: experiential factors that promote or inhibit the choice to seek {TOP}; experiences of {TOP}; and experiential aspects of the environment in which {TOP} takes place.

{CONCLUSION}: Women's choices about {TOP} are mainly pragmatic ones that are related to negotiating finite personal and family and emotional resources. Women who are well informed and supported in their choices experience good psychosocial outcomes from {TOP}. Home {TOP} using mifepristone appears attractive to women who are concerned about professionals' negative attitudes and lack of privacy in formal healthcare settings but also leads to concerns about management and safety.},

Results suggest that the {RSES} is a two-dimensional scale comprising the highly correlated components positive and negative self-evaluation, which constitute a unitary construct of global self-esteem at the second-order level. In order to obtain a more conclusive solution, an item response theory ({IRT}) analysis (partial credit model) was conducted. Results lend support to a one-dimensional view of the {RSES}. Furthermore, psychometric properties and norm values based on the representative sample are reported. Analyses revealed extremely high response probabilities for all items, as a consequence of which self-esteem cannot be differentiated at the upper end of the range.},

There are individual differences in rational thinking that are less than perfectly correlated with individual differences in intelligence because intelligence and rationality occupy different conceptual locations in models of cognition. A tripartite extension of currently popular dual-process theories is presented in this chapter that illustrates how intelligence and rationality are theoretically separate concepts. The chapter concludes by showing how this tripartite model of mind, taken in the context of studies of individual differences, can help to resolve the Great Rationality Debate.},

Das Konzept der Organisationskultur beschreibt tief verankerte Werte und Annahmen, die häufig den Organisationsmitgliedern nicht bewusst sind. Eine Organisation lässt sich wie eine „Minigesellschaft`` betrachten, die ihre eigene Geschichte hat, eine spezielle Sprache ausbildet, in der bestimmte Rituale und Zeremonien entstehen und die durch eigene Artefakte gekennzeichnet ist.

	url = {http://jap.physiology.org/content/71/2/488.abstract},
	abstract = {Several investigators have observed that irregular breathing occurs during rapid-eye-movement ({REM}) sleep in healthy subjects, with ventilatory suppression being prominent during active eye movements [phasic {REM} ({PREM}) sleep] as opposed to tonic {REM} ({TREM}) sleep, when ocular activity is absent and ventilation more regular. Inasmuch as considerable data suggest that rapid eye movements are a manifestation of sleep-induced neural events that may importantly influence respiratory neurons, we hypothesized that upper airway dilator muscle activation may also be suppressed during periods of active eye movements in {REM} sleep. We studied six normal men during single nocturnal sleep studies. Standard sleep-staging parameters, ventilation, and genioglossus and alae nasi electromyograms ({EMG}) were continuously recorded during the study. There were no significant differences in minute ventilation, tidal volume, or any index of genioglossus or alae nasi {EMG} amplitude between non-{REM} ({NREM}) and {REM} sleep, when {REM} was analyzed as a single sleep stage. Each breath during {REM} sleep was scored as "phasic" or "tonic," depending on its proximity to {REM} deflections on the electrooculogram. Comparison of all three sleep states ({NREM}, {PREM}, and {TREM}) revealed that peak inspiratory genioglossus and alae nasi {EMG} activities were significantly decreased during {PREM} sleep compared with {TREM} sleep [genioglossus (arbitrary units): {NREM} 49 +/- 12 (mean +/- {SE}), {TREM} 49 +/- 5, {PREM} 20 +/- 5 (P less than 0.05, {PREM} different from {TREM} and {NREM}); alae nasi: {NREM} 16 +/- 4, {TREM} 38 +/- 7, {PREM} 10 +/- 4 (P less than 0.05, {PREM} different from {TREM})]. We also observed, as have others, that ventilation, tidal volume, and mean inspiratory airflow were significantly decreased and respiratory frequency was increased during {PREM} sleep compared with both {TREM} and {NREM} sleep. We conclude that hypoventilation occurs in concert with reduced upper airway dilator muscle activation during {PREM} sleep by mechanisms that remain to be established.},

These must be interpreted correctly for a proper understanding of the findings. {METHODS}: The authors present basic statistical concepts required for the analysis of nominal data, referring to standard works in statistics. {RESULTS}: The relative risk and odds ratio are defined to be indices for the relationship between two binary quantities (e.g., exposure--yes/no and disease--yes/no). The topics dealt with in this article include the effect of sample size on the length of the confidence interval and the p-value, and also inaccuracies caused by measuring error. Exposures are often expressed on a three-level scale (none, low, high). The authors also consider the 2 x 3 table as an extension of the 2 x 2 table and discuss the categorization of continuous measurements. Typically, more than one factor is involved in the development of a disease. The effect that a further factor can have on the observed relationship between the exposure and the disease is discussed. {CONCLUSIONS}: Sample size, measurement error, categorization, and confounders influence the statistical interpretation of 2 x 2 tables in many ways. Readers of scientific publications should know the inherent problems in the interpretation of simple 2 x 2 tables and check that the authors have taken these into account adequately in analyzing and interpreting their data.},

	abstract = {{STUDY} {DESIGN}: Descriptive method guidelines.

{OBJECTIVES}: To help reviewers design, conduct, and report reviews of trials in the field of back and neck pain.

{SUMMARY} {OF} {BACKGROUND} {DATA}: In 1997, the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group published method guidelines for systematic reviews. Since its publication, new methodologic evidence emerged and more experience was acquired in conducting reviews.

{METHODS}: All reviews and protocols of the Back Review Group were assessed for compliance with the 1997 method guidelines. Also, the most recent version of the Cochrane Handbook (4.1) was checked for new recommendations. In addition, some important topics that were not addressed in the 1997 method guidelines were included (e.g., methods for qualitative analysis, reporting of conclusions, and discussion of clinical relevance of the results). In May 2002, preliminary results were presented and discussed in a workshop. In two rounds, a list of all possible recommendations and the final draft were circulated for comments among the editors of the Back Review Group.

{RESULTS}: The recommendations are divided in five categories: literature search, inclusion criteria, methodologic quality assessment, data extraction, and data analysis. Each recommendation is classified in minimum criteria and further guidance. Additional recommendations are included regarding assessment of clinical relevance, and reporting of results and conclusions.

{CONCLUSIONS}: Systematic reviews need to be conducted as carefully as the trials they report and, to achieve full impact, systematic reviews need to meet high methodologic standards.},

	abstract = {Despite the large potential role that community nurses have in providing individualized health promotion to older people, there is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding this role's effectiveness and efficiency. This article presents a literature review and synthesis of 12 randomized controlled trials selected from 344 published studies on preventive home visitation programs for older people. The findings suggest that a diversity of home visiting interventions carried out by nurses can favorably affect health and functional status, mortality rates, use of hospitalization and nursing homes, and costs. Further research is needed that focuses on the outcomes of quality of life, mental health, social support, caregiver burden, the acceptability of intervention, and specific subgroups of clients who benefit most. Findings also indicate the need for a theoretical foundation, increased emphasis on health-promotion strategies, and more research using a more complete economic evaluation to establish efficiency.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The objective of our study was to develop a theory-based and empirically tested instrument for measuring patient-reported 'psychosocial care by physicians'. We propose a model integrating patients' perceptions with respect to: (i) devotion by physicians, (ii) support by physicians, (iii) information by physicians and (iv) shared decision-making ({SDM}). {DESIGN}: Data were gathered during 2001 within a cross-sectional, retrospective mail survey. {PARTICIPANTS} {AND} {SETTING}: A total of 4192 inpatients of six German hospitals. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURE}: Specific scales of the Cologne Patient Questionnaire were used. A two-step structural equation model procedure was applied. In the first structural equation model, all items were modeled as indicators of the intended underlying latent construct, 'psychosocial care by physicians'. In the second structural equation model, criterion-related validity of the intended construct was tested with respect to patients' 'satisfaction', 'trust in physicians' and the 'image of the hospital'. {RESULTS}: The results confirmed that the aspects of psychosocial care provided by physicians measured by the scale items are indeed indicators of the same construct. Furthermore, indicator reliabilities and selectivities revealed that the content of all 13 items was highly representative of the underlying construct. The second structural equation model showed that 'psychosocial care by physicians' is related to 'patients' satisfaction', 'trust in physicians' and 'hospital-image' in a significant and relevant manner. {CONCLUSION}: On the basis of our instrument's reported psychometric characteristics and of the initial validity indicators, it may be regarded as an adequate measure for further use in outcome and intervention research, and as a quality indicator for the physician-patient relationship.},

The shape of the two-dimensional affective space defined by the mean ratings for each sound was similar to that previously obtained for pictures, and, like memory for pictures, free recall was highest for emotionally arousing stimuli. In Experiment 2, autonomic and facial electromyographic ({EMG}) activity were recorded while a new group of subjects listened to the same set of sounds; the startle reflex was measured using visual probes. Listening to unpleasant sounds resulted in larger startle reflexes, more corrugator {EMG} activity, and larger heart rate deceleration compared with listening to pleasant sounds. Electrodermal reactions were larger for emotionally arousing than for neutral materials. Taken together, the data suggest that acoustic cues activate the appetitive and defensive motivational circuits underlying emotional expression in ways similar to pictures.},

Enduring individual differences in self-control were found as early as the preschool years. Those 4-year-old children who delayed gratification longer in certain laboratory situations developed into more cognitively and socially competent adolescents, achieving higher scholastic performance and coping better with frustration and stress. Experiments in the same research program also identified specific cognitive and attentional processes that allow effective self-regulation early in the course of development. The experimental results, in turn, specified the particular types of preschool delay situations diagnostic for predicting aspects of cognitive and social competence later in life.},

Although {WM} capacity has been viewed as a constant trait, recent studies suggest that it can be improved by adaptive and extended training. This training is associated with changes in brain activity in frontal and parietal cortex and basal ganglia, as well as changes in dopamine receptor density. Transfer of the training effects to non-trained {WM} tasks is consistent with the notion of training-induced plasticity in a common neural network for {WM}. The observed training effects suggest that {WM} training could be used as a remediating intervention for individuals for whom low {WM} capacity is a limiting factor for academic performance or in everyday life. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The present work describes the resource's structure, the three sources utilised to assemble it and the semi-supervised method incorporated to weight the strength of its entries. Furthermore the resource's contents are extensively evaluated using a German-language evaluation set we constructed. The evaluation set is verified being reliable and its shown that {SentiWS} provides a beneficial lexical resource for German-language sentiment analysis related tasks to build on.},

Over-selectivity occurs when behavior is controlled by a limited number of stimuli in the environment. Mindfulness is a construct that specifically targets attention and awareness of the present moment. The current study aimed to remediate over-selectivity in an elderly population by means of a focused attention/mindfulness induction. The results of this study indicated that the level of emergent over-selectivity in an elderly population was significantly reduced after a focused attention induction when compared to an unfocused attention induction.

In this article, we pose three questions: (a) Are people willing to self-impose meaningful (i.e., costly) deadlines to overcome procrastination? (b) Are self-imposed deadlines effective in improving task performance? (c) When self-imposing deadlines, do people set them optimally, for maximum performance enhancement? A set of studies examined these issues experimentally, showing that the answer is "yes" to the first two questions, and "no" to the third. People have self-control problems, they recognize them, and they try to control them by self-imposing costly deadlines. These deadlines help people control procrastination, hit they are not as effective as some externally imposed deadlines in improving task performance.},

The paper describes two experiments that manipulate the social category relations between (a) bystander and fellow bystanders, and (b) bystander and victim. Analysis indicates that fellow bystanders are only influential when they are in-group rather than out-group members. Furthermore, bystanders are more likely to help victims who are described as in-group as opposed to out-group members. Overall, the findings suggest an important role for a self-categorization perspective in developing strategies to promote bystander intervention.},

In 5 natural settings, focusing Ss on either the descriptive norms or the injunctive norms regarding littering caused the Ss' littering decisions to change only in accord with the dictates of the then more salient type of norm.},

Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

Additionally, consistent with prediction, mindfulness-based attention demonstrated incremental validity in relation to perceived health, and the degree of impairment of health in terms of physical and mental functioning.

	abstract = {In recent years, three attentional networks have been defined in anatomical and functional terms. These functions involve alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Reaction time measures can be used to quantify the processing efficiency within each of these three networks. The Attention Network Test ({ANT}) is designed to evaluate alerting, orienting, and executive attention within a single 30-min testing session that can be easily performed by children, patients, and monkeys. A study with 40 normal adult subjects indicates that the {ANT} produces reliable single subject estimates of alerting, orienting, and executive function, and further suggests that the efficiencies of these three networks are uncorrelated. There are, however, some interactions in which alerting and orienting can modulate the degree of interference from flankers. This procedure may prove to be convenient and useful in evaluating attentional abnormalities associated with cases of brain injury, stroke, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit disorder. The {ANT} may also serve as an activation task for neuroimaging studies and as a phenotype for the study of the influence of genes on attentional networks.},

	abstract = {Eine empirische Beforschung des Achtsamkeitskonzepts erfordert auch die Erfassung des Konstruktes selbst. Ob dies prinzipiell mit dem gegebenen metho- dischen Inventar der Psychologie möglich ist, wird kurz diskutiert. Zwei bereits im eng- lischen Sprachraum existierende Instrumente werden skizziert, bevor die Konstruktion und Validierung des Freiburger Fragebogens zur Achtsamkeit ({FFA}) beschrieben wird. Zunächst wurde auf der Basis einer Literaturstudie und anschließender Bewertung durch {ExpertInnen} ein Fragebogen mit 38 Items erarbeitet. Dieser wurde an Stichproben von 115 {TeilnehmerInnen} an einem Vipassana-Retreat jeweils vor und nach dem Retreat aus- gefüllt. Aus diesen Daten konnte die 30-Item-Langform des {FFA} gebildet werden, die mit einer internen Konsistenz von r = .93 und einer Vierfaktorenstruktur gute psychometri- sche Kennwerte aufweist. In einer weiteren Validierungsstudie wurde diese Langform an drei Stichproben ausgege- ben: 65 Personen, die an Achtsamkeitskursen teilnahmen, 86 Personen, die keine weiteren Verbindungen zu buddhistischen oder Meditationskonzepten hatten, sowie an eine klini- sche Stichprobe von 117 Personen. Die Stichprobe der Normalbevölkerung wies für einige Items eine geringe Trennschärfe auf. Offensichtlich werden diese nur von Menschen, die mit dem Achtsamkeitskonzept vertraut sind, semantisch verstanden. Lässt man diese schwierigen Items weg, ergibt sich eine semantisch und psychometrisch robuste Kurzform mit 14 Items (a = .87). In einer Faktorenanalyse zeigte sich hier anstatt der Vierfaktoren- struktur ein Generalfaktor. Die Korrelation mit anderen Skalen ergab eine überzeugende Validierung. Das Instrument korreliert positiv mit privater Selbstaufmerksamkeit (r = .29) und Selbstkenntnis (r = .55), jedoch negativ mit Dissoziation (r = --.29) und psychi- scher Belastung (r = --40).},

After deleting one item (physician's manner and attitude) for its redundancy suggested by interitem correlations, exploratory factor analysis yielded two factors, General Service and Case Physician, explaining 75\% of variance of the remaining nine items. The internal consistency coefficients of the whole scale and the two subscales were higher than 0.90. Criterion-related validity was supported by high correlations with three anchor items, overall satisfaction, intended future reutilization, and recommendation to others (r = 0.38-0.85). Significant correlations with compliance and negative affects provided preliminary evidence for construct validity. {CONCLUSION}: The psychometric properties of the resulting 9-item scale supported its usefulness in measuring outpatient satisfaction. Further validation studies in various specialties and countries are suggested to make future cross-cultural comparisons possible.},

	abstract = {As computers became ubiquitous in businesses, homes, and schools, there was increasing concern about computer anxiety and its effect on individuals. The first academic articles on computer anxiety were published in the early 1980s. Since that time, hundreds of papers have been published on the topic. Yet, up to this time, no one has done a comprehensive review of computer anxiety. In this article, 276 articles on computer anxiety are reviewed. From a synthesis of the articles and variables studied to date, a framework is developed that outlines the primary topics studied in computer anxiety literature. Nine antecedents, five correlates, and two outcomes of computer anxiety are identified as the most studied variables in the literature. In addition, a statistical comparison is done to compare the distribution of computer anxiety topics and results published in the 1990s to those published in the 2000s. Suggestions for future research in computer anxiety are proposed.},

	abstract = {We use a power-to-resist game to find out the effects of individuals' judgments about a proposer's selection procedure on the willingness to offer resistance to proposed outcomes. In the experiment, one individual is selected based on a particular procedure. This individual is allowed to propose how to allocate a pie among five group members: herself and four responders. Then each responder in the group can decide whether to offer costly resistance to the proposed allocation. Resistance is modeled as a threshold public good. If the resistance is successful, the proposer receives nothing. If resistance is unsuccessful, the pie is distributed according to the proposer's decision. We find that resistance increases with (a) the size of the proposal, with (b) subjectively perceived unfairness of the selection procedure for the proposer's role, and with (c) the individual procedural preferences being unsatisfied. Surprisingly, resistance is not affected by whether the group's majority vote on the selection procedure is respected. We check for the robustness of our results and find that the results are stable over two countries. The presented evidence suggests that procedural effects over and above outcomes are relevant in strategic interaction.},

Most commonly, though, the rule fails in discrete distributions where the areas to the left and right of the median are not equal. Such distributions not only contradict the textbook relationship between mean, median, and skew, they also contradict the textbook interpretation of the median.

That goal can be achieved only through complete transparency from authors. Despite several decades of educational efforts, the reporting of {RCTs} needs improvement. Investigators and editors developed the original {CONSORT} (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to help authors improve reporting by using a checklist and flow diagram. The revised {CONSORT} statement presented in this paper incorporates new evidence and addresses some criticisms of the original statement. The checklist items pertain to the content of the Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. The revised checklist includes 22 items selected because empirical evidence indicates that not reporting the information is associated with biased estimates of treatment effect or because the information is essential to judge the reliability or relevance of the findings. We intended the flow diagram to depict the passage of participants through an {RCT}. The revised flow diagram depicts information from four stages of trial (enrollment, intervention allocation, follow-up, and analysis). The diagram explicitly includes the number of participants, for each intervention group, that are included in the primary data analysis. Inclusion of these numbers allows the reader to judge whether the authors have performed an intention-to-treat analysis. In sum, the {CONSORT} statement is intended to improve the reporting of an {RCT}, enabling readers to understand a trial's conduct and to assess the validity of its results.},

However, it was less investigated how perceived enthusiasm is related to cheating. In the first exploratory questionnaire study (N = 244) we found that during the exams of those teachers who are perceived to be enthusiastic students tend to cheat less. In the second questionnaire study (N = 266) we took academic motivations into consideration and we found that the more teachers seem enthusiastic the cheating rate will be lower among university students. Aggregated teacher enthusiasm was positively related to intrinsic motivation, negatively related to amotivation, and not related to extrinsic motivation. Aggregated teacher enthusiasm was directly and negatively linked to cheating and it explained more variance in cheating than academic motivations together. These results suggest that teachers' perceived enthusiasm can be a yet unexplored interpersonal factor which could effectively prevent academic cheating.},

The meditation groups engaged in 10-minute sessions at school and at home after school each day for 3 months. Resting (seated) systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate measurements were obtained pretest and posttest on three consecutive school days using Dinamap 1846SX monitors.

Participants had to memorize tedious material while being tempted by pictures pasted on the wall (Study 1) or by funny clips on the television (Study 2). In Study 1, compared to a control group, participants who were instructed to reappraise the task as an opportunity to improve their memory (1) were less tempted by the pictures, (2) maintained their enthusiasm for the task, and (3) showed better performance in a subsequent memory test. Study 2 replicated and extended the findings from Study 1, showing that cognitive reappraisal is effective whether the target of reappraisal is the temptation itself, or the longer term goal. Taken together, our findings provide compelling evidence that cognitive reappraisal (of either the task or the temptation) may be a useful tool for increasing students' task performance and enthusiasm. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..},

	abstract = {Much biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ({STROBE}) initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September, 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of {STROBE} contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the {STROBE} statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles.18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies.A detailed explanation and elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the websites of {PLoS} Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the {STROBE} statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies},

Self-esteem proved irrelevant to aggression. The combination of narcissism and insult led to exceptionally high levels of aggression toward the source of the insult. Neither form of self-regard affected displaced aggression, which was low in general.

It is shown that, in regression, when there are many candidate independent variables, standard variable selection procedures can give very misleading results. Also, by selecting a single model, they ignore model uncertainty and so underestimate the uncertainty about quantities of interest. The Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing, model selection, and accounting for model uncertainty is presented. Implementing this is straightforward through the use of the simple and accurate {BIC} approximation, and it can be done using the output from standard software. Specific results are presented for most of the types of model commonly used in sociology. It is shown that this approach overcomes the difficulties with P-values and standard model selection procedures based on them. It also allows easy comparison of nonnested models, and permits the quantification of the evidence for a null hypothesis of interest, such as a convergence theory or a hypothesis about societal norms.},

The identification of factors that may enhance behavioral and emotional regulation after quitting may be useful in enhancing quit rates and preventing relapse. One factor broadly linked with behavioral and emotional regulation is mindfulness. This study examined baseline associations of mindfulness with demographic variables, smoking history, dependence, withdrawal severity, and agency among 158 smokers enrolled in a cessation trial. Results indicated that mindfulness was negatively associated with level of nicotine dependence and withdrawal severity, and positively associated with a sense of agency regarding cessation. Moreover, mindfulness remained significantly associated with these measures even after controlling for key demographic variables. Results suggest that low level of mindfulness may be an important predictor of vulnerability to relapse among adult smokers preparing to quit; thus, mindfulness-based interventions may enhance cessation.},

Recent research within the social-cognitive framework illustrates adaptive and maladaptive motivational patterns, and a research-based model of motivational processes is presented that shows how the particular performance or learning goals children pursue on cognitive tasks shape their reactions to success and failure and influence the quality of their cognitive performance. Implications for practice and the design of interventions to change maladaptive motivational processes are outlined. It is suggested that motivational patterns may contribute to gender differences in mathematics achievement and that empirically based interventions may prevent current achievement discrepancies and provide a basis for more effective socialization.

The many demonstrations that uncertainties can only combine according to the rules of the probability calculus are summarized. The conclusion is that statistical inference is firmly based on probability alone. Progress is therefore dependent on the construction of a probability model; methods for doing this are considered. It is argued that the probabilities are personal. The roles of likelihood and exchangeability are explained. Inference is only of value if it can be used, so the extension to decision analysis, incorporating utility, is related to risk and to the use of statistics in science and law.

All three studies showed this effect to occur even though the person striving to bask in the glory of a successful source was not involved in the cause of the source's success. Experiment 1 demonstrated the {BIRG} phenome- non by showing a greater tendency for university students to wear school- identifying apparel after their school's football team had been victorious than nonvictorious. Experiments 2 and 3 replicated this effect by showing that stu- dents used the pronoun we more when describing a victory than a nonvictory of their school's football team. A model was developed asserting that the {BIRG} response represents an attempt to enhance one's public image. Experiments 2 and 3 indicated, in support of this assertion, that the tendency to proclaim a connection with a positive source was strongest when one's public image was threatened.},

But a distinction between mysticism and orthodox religion has been recognized by scholars as well as laypersons, and empirical studies of "ism" variables and of "spirituality" measures have yielded factors reflecting this distinction. Using a large sample of American adults, analyses demonstrate that subjective spirituality and tradition-oriented religiousness are empirically highly independent and have distinctly different correlates in the personality domain, suggesting that individuals with different dispositions tend toward different styles of religious/spiritual beliefs. These dimensions have low correlations with the lexical Big Five but high correlations with scales (e.g., Absorption, Traditionalism) on some omnibus personality inventories, indicating their relevance for studies of personality.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: We have previously studied prospective associations between computer use and mental health symptoms in a selected young adult population. The purpose of this study was to investigate if high computer use is a prospective risk factor for developing mental health symptoms in a population-based sample of young adults.

{METHODS}: The study group was a cohort of young adults (n = 4163), 20-24 years old, who responded to a questionnaire at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Exposure variables included time spent on computer use ({CU}) in general, email/chat use, computer gaming, {CU} without breaks, and {CU} at night causing lost sleep. Mental health outcomes included perceived stress, sleep disturbances, symptoms of depression, and reduced performance due to stress, depressed mood, or tiredness. Prevalence ratios ({PRs}) were calculated for prospective associations between exposure variables at baseline and mental health outcomes (new cases) at 1-year follow-up for the men and women separately.

{RESULTS}: Both high and medium computer use compared to low computer use at baseline were associated with sleep disturbances in the men at follow-up. High email/chat use was negatively associated with perceived stress, but positively associated with reported sleep disturbances for the men. For the women, high email/chat use was (positively) associated with several mental health outcomes, while medium computer gaming was associated with symptoms of depression, and {CU} without breaks with most mental health outcomes. {CU} causing lost sleep was associated with mental health outcomes for both men and women.

{CONCLUSIONS}: Time spent on general computer use was prospectively associated with sleep disturbances and reduced performance for the men. For the women, using the computer without breaks was a risk factor for several mental health outcomes. Some associations were enhanced in interaction with mobile phone use. Using the computer at night and consequently losing sleep was associated with most mental health outcomes for both men and women. Further studies should focus on mechanisms relating information and communication technology ({ICT}) use to sleep disturbances.},

	abstract = {Abstract The task of modeling the distribution of a large number of tree species under future climate scenarios presents unique challenges. First, the model must be robust enough to handle climate data outside the current range without producing unacceptable instability in the output. In addition, the technique should have automatic search mechanisms built in to select the most appropriate values for input model parameters for each species so that minimal effort is required when these parameters are fine-tuned for individual tree species. We evaluated four statistical models---Regression Tree Analysis ({RTA}), Bagging Trees ({BT}), Random Forests ({RF}), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines ({MARS})---for predictive vegetation mapping under current and future climate scenarios according to the Canadian Climate Centre global circulation model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the four techniques were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa statistics, {RF} and {BT} were superior in reproducing current importance value (a measure of basal area in addition to abundance) distributions for the four tree species, as derived from approximately 100,000 {USDA} Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of suitable habitat after climate change were visually more reasonable with {BT} and {RF}, with slightly better performance by {RF} as assessed by Kappa statistics, correlation estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values. Although {RTA} did not perform as well as {BT} and {RF}, it provided interpretive models for species whose distributions were captured well by our current set of predictors. {MARS} was adequate for predicting current distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We consider {RTA}, {BT}, and {RF} modeling approaches, especially when used together to take advantage of their individual strengths, to be robust for predictive mapping and recommend their inclusion in the ecological toolbox.},

During the time that an incentive is behaviorally salient, an organism is especially responsive to incentive-related cues. This sustained sensitivity requires postulating a continuing state (denoted by a construct, current concern) with a definite onset (commitment) and offset (consummation or disengagement). Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species. The theory offers implications for motivation; etiology, symptomatology, and treatment of depression; drug use; and other social problem areas.},

Evaluation of face and content validity, feasibility, factor structure, reliability and construct validity. {SETTING}: Forty-one community pharmacies of the province of Santa Fe. Argentina. {PARTICIPANTS}: Questionnaire administered to patients receiving pharmaceutical care or traditional pharmacy services. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURE}: Pilot test to assess feasibility. Factor analysis used principal components and varimax rotation. Reliability established using internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha. Construct validity determined with extreme group method. {RESULTS}: A self-administered questionnaire with 27 items, 5-point Likert response scale and demographic questions was designed considering multidimensional structure of patient satisfaction. Questionnaire evaluates cumulative experience of patients with comprehensive pharmaceutical care practice in community pharmacies. Two hundred and seventy-four complete questionnaires were obtained. Factor analysis resulted in three factors: Managing therapy, Interpersonal relationship and General satisfaction, with a cumulative variance of 62.51\%. Cronbach's alpha for the whole questionnaire was 0.96, and 0.95, 0.88 and 0.76 for the three factors, respectively. Mann-Whitney test for construct validity did not showed significant differences between pharmacies that provide pharmaceutical care and those that do not, however, 23 items showed significant differences between the two groups of pharmacies. {CONCLUSION}: The questionnaire developed can be a reliable and valid instrument to assess patient satisfaction with pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies in Spanish. Further research is needed to deepen the validation process.},

All 3 experiments included a condition in which a requester first asked for an extreme favor (which was refused to him) and then for a smaller favor. In each instance, this procedure produced more compliance with the smaller favor than a procedure in which the requester asked solely for the smaller favor. Additional control conditions in each experiment support the hypothesis that the effect is mediated by a rule for reciprocation of concessions. Several advantages to the use of the rejection-then-moderation procedure for producing compliance are discussed. (15 ref) ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2013 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

This makes a suitable categorization for scientific use almost impossible. However, empirical data suggest that different forms of meditation show similar steps of development in terms of their neurophysiological correlates. Some electrophysiological alterations can be observed on the beginner/student level, which are closely related to non-meditative processes. Others seem to correspond to an advanced/expert level, and seem to be unique for meditation-related states of consciousness. Meditation is one possibility to specialize brain/mind functions using the brain's immanent neural plasticity. This plasticity is probably recruited by certain {EEG} patterns observed during or as a result of meditation, for instance, synchronized gamma oscillations. While meditation formerly has been understood to comprise mainly passive relaxation states, recent {EEG} findings suggest that meditation is associated with active states which involve cognitive restructuring and learning.},

There is a critical need for the establishment of a biomarker that accurately measures its intensity and course over time. Such a biomarker would allow monitoring of stress, increase understanding of its pathophysiology and may help identify appropriate and successful management strategies. Whereas saliva and urine cortisol capture real-time levels, hair cortisol analysis presents a complementary means of monitoring stress, capturing systemic cortisol exposure over longer periods of time. This novel approach for cortisol quantification is being increasingly used to identify the effects of stress in a variety of pathological situations, from chronic pain to acute myocardial infarctions. Because of its ability to provide a long-term, month-by-month measure of systemic cortisol exposure, hair cortisol analysis is becoming a useful tool, capable of answering clinical questions that could previously not be answered by other tests. In this paper we review the development, current status, limitations and outstanding questions regarding the use of hair cortisol as a biomarker of chronic stress.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Reproducibility is the hallmark of good science. Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow.: Version control systems ({VCS}), which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source {VCS}, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.},

Differential activity was found for emotional, compared to neutral, pictures at both of the P3 intervals, as well as enhancement of later posterior positivity.

	abstract = {The R package mice imputes incomplete multivariate data by chained equations. The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-{PLUS} library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice , the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

Themes of physical, emotional, and mental changes were present in both sets of responses. Additional themes of familiarity with the practice as well as group consciousness and interdependence emerged in the final experience of qigong. The results of this study indicate qigong is a contemplative practice that could have positive outcomes for counseling students. Because of its accessible nature, immediate results, and ability to foster connectedness, qigong is currently underutilized as a form of teaching mindfulness.},

A number of studies have suggested that such priming effects can occur, and a prominent illustration is the claim that individuals' accuracy in answering general knowledge questions can be influenced by activating intelligence-related concepts such as {\textless}italic{\textgreater}professor{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} or {\textless}italic{\textgreater}soccer hooligan{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. In 9 experiments with 475 participants we employed the procedures used in these studies, as well as a number of variants of those procedures, in an attempt to obtain this intelligence priming effect. None of the experiments obtained the effect, although financial incentives did boost performance. A Bayesian analysis reveals considerable evidential support for the null hypothesis. The results conform to the pattern typically obtained in word priming experiments in which priming is very narrow in its generalization and unconscious (subliminal) influences, if they occur at all, are extremely short-lived. We encourage others to explore the circumstances in which this phenomenon might be obtained.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Bayesian methods, including the Bayesian information criterion, are also mentioned in the context of the framework outlined in the paper. The ideas are illustrated using an example in which observations are available for the entire population of interest. This enables us to examine and to measure effects that are usually invisible, because in practical applications only a sample from the population is observed. The problem of selection bias, a hazard of which one needs to be aware in the context of model selection, is also discussed. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

When data are well presented, it is usually obvious whether the author has collected and evaluated them correctly and in keeping with accepted practice in the field. {METHODS}: Statistical variables in medicine may be of either the metric (continuous, quantitative) or categorical (nominal, ordinal) type. Easily understandable examples are given. Basic techniques for the statistical description of collected data are presented and illustrated with examples. {RESULTS}: The goal of a scientific study must always be clearly defined. The definition of the target value or clinical endpoint determines the level of measurement of the variables in question. Nearly all variables, whatever their level of measurement, can be usefully presented graphically and numerically. The level of measurement determines what types of diagrams and statistical values are appropriate. There are also different ways of presenting combinations of two independent variables graphically and numerically. {CONCLUSIONS}: The description of collected data is indispensable. If the data are of good quality, valid and important conclusions can already be drawn when they are properly described. Furthermore, data description provides a basis for inferential statistics.},

Both sets of personality traits were related to a wide variety of life course variables representing the domains of global adult adjustment, career functioning/success, creativity, social relations, mental health, substance abuse, childhood characteristics, familial history of pathology, maturity of defenses, and political attitudes. Conscientiousness in college was the best predictor of what happened to the men in the future, whereas Neuroticism in late midlife was the best correlate of life course functioning across a variety of domains.},

The methodology can mislead researchers in several ways, including: (a) a lack of power can result in an erroneous rejection of the theory; (b) the focus on directionality (ordinal tests) rather than more precise quantitative predictions limits the information gained; and (c) the misuse of probability values to indicate effect size. An alternative approach is proposed which involves employing the theory to generate explicit effect size predictions that are compared to the effect size estimates and related confidence intervals to test the theoretical predictions. This procedure is illustrated employing the Transtheoretical Model. Data from a sample (N = 3,967) of smokers from a large New England {HMO} system were used to test the model. There were a total of 15 predictions evaluated, each involving the relation between Stage of Change and one of the other 15 Transtheoretical Model variables. For each variable, omega-squared and the related confidence interval were calculated and compared to the predicted effect sizes. Eleven of the 15 predictions were confirmed, providing support for the theoretical model. Quantitative predictions represent a much more direct, informative, and strong test of a theory than the traditional test of significance.},

Results demonstrated that perceivers did indeed spontaneously attend to smile type, especially in situations where issues of trust or cooperation were made salient. Further, this sensitivity had an impact both on the evaluations of the target individuals and the cooperative behaviour of individuals towards those displaying enjoyment and non-enjoyment smiles. Participants evaluated individuals displaying enjoyment smiles more positively than those displaying non-enjoyment smiles and had higher rates of cooperation with those displaying enjoyment smiles.

	abstract = {An important problem exists in the interpretation of modern medical research data: Biological understanding and previous research play little formal role in the interpretation of quantitative results. This phenomenon is manifest in the discussion sections of research articles and ultimately can affect the reliability of conclusions. The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions can be produced with certain "error rates," without consideration of information from outside the experiment. This statistical approach, the key components of which are P values and hypothesis tests, is widely perceived as a mathematically coherent approach to inference. There is little appreciation in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgam of incompatible elements, whose utility for scientific inference has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for almost 70 years. This article introduces some of the key elements of that debate and traces the appeal and adverse impact of this methodology to the P value fallacy, the mistaken idea that a single number can capture both the long-run outcomes of an experiment and the evidential meaning of a single result. This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used--the Bayes factor, which properly separates issues of long-run behavior from evidential strength and allows the integration of background knowledge with statistical findings.},

{METHODS}: The examination was based on the {PSQ} and on standardized quality of life and personality questionnaires. The analyses focused on structural equation modeling. A total of 2552 subjects from a population-based survey were studied.

{RESULTS}: A transactional model fitted the data. Personality aspects and resources contribute to the total perceived stress. Yet the physical aspects of quality of life receive a comparatively low weighting. The prevalence of perceived stress at a moderate level was estimated to be 14.5\%, lowest in the age group{\textgreater}75 years and highest in the 35- to 54-year age group. The prevalence of high stress was 3.1\%. The total {PSQ}-30 score of the general population was 0.30 (S.D.=0.15), slightly higher in women than in men.

{CONCLUSION}: We consider the {PSQ} as a valid instrument for recording subjective perceived stress in the context of a transactional view of stress. The present broad and international database suggests that it needs further investigation in terms of transcultural studies.},

The journey begins by explaining basic statistical and research concepts before a guided tour of the R software environment. Next you discover the importance of exploring and graphing data, before moving onto statistical tests that are the foundations of the rest of the book (for example correlation and regression). You will then stride confidently into intermediate level analyses such as {ANOVA}, before ending your journey with advanced techniques such as {MANOVA} and multilevel models. Although there is enough theory to help you gain the necessary conceptual understanding of what you're doing, the emphasis is on applying what you learn to playful and real-world examples that should make the experience more fun than you might expect. Like its sister textbooks, Discovering Statistics Using R is written in an irreverent style and follows the same ground-breaking structure and pedagogical approach. The core material is augmented by a cast of characters to help the reader on their way, together with hundreds of examples, self-assessment tests to consolidate knowledge, and additional website material for those wanting to learn more at: Instructor Site. Given this book's accessibility, fun spirit, and use of bizarre real-world research it should be essential for anyone wanting to learn about statistics using the freely-available R software.},

The notion of a conflict between reflective and impulsive processing which is incorporated in prominent dual-system accounts (e.g., Metcalfe \& Mischel, 1999; Strack \& Deutsch, 2004) may yield important benefits for the understanding and prediction of health-related behavior. In this article, we suggest a basic framework for the prediction of health-related behavior which combines (a) reflective influences (as measured via self-report), (b) impulsive influences (as measured via implicit measures), and (c) situational or dispositional moderators that shift the weight between reflective and impulsive influences. The practical utility of such a framework is demonstrated by drawing on recent evidence from several areas of health psychology such as eating, drinking, drug abuse, and sexual behavior. Implications for the understanding of health behavior and applied health interventions are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Analytic Hierarchy Process ({AHP}) is one of the popular and powerful techniques for decision making. A detailed survey of the literature has revealed that there exists no formal evaluation of the group preference aggregation methods currently employed in {AHP}. This paper provides such an evaluation using well established social choice axioms, which govern the process of combining individual opinions to obtain a single group opinion. The Geometric Mean Method ({GMM}) and the Weighted Arithmetic Mean Method ({WAMM}) are the two methods evaluated. It is shown, using counter-examples, that the {GMM} does not always satisfy the Pareto optimality axiom, which is one of the prominent and widely accepted social choice axioms. This finding is significant as the {GMM} has been the most commonly used method in {AHP} for combining individual opinions to form a group opinion. The other method, viz. {WAMM} has satisfied all the axioms, except the `independence of irrelevant alternatives' axiom. In order to use the {WAMM}, one has to find the weightages (importance) to be assigned to the members of the group. This is often a difficult task, especially so if the group is large as in the case of public policy decisions and when judgements are elicited through the use of questionnaires. These situations need an objective method to derive members' weightages but only a few studies are available in the literature to address such a situation. We propose a simple and intuitively appealing eigenvector based method to intrinsically determine the weightages for group members using their own subjective opinions. The superiority of the proposed method over the previous methods is brought out in the paper.},

In particular, subjects are significantly more likely to offer an even division of the pie in the first period, clustering on a focal distribution before exploring other offers.

	abstract = {Most researchers acknowledge an intrinsic hierarchy in the scholarly journals ("journal rank") that they submit their work to, and adjust not only their submission but also their reading strategies accordingly. On the other hand, much has been written about the negative effects of institutionalizing journal rank as an impact measure. So far, contributions to the debate concerning the limitations of journal rank as a scientific impact assessment tool have either lacked data, or relied on only a few studies. In this review, we present the most recent and pertinent data on the consequences of our current scholarly communication system with respect to various measures of scientific quality (such as utility/citations, methodological soundness, expert ratings or retractions). These data corroborate previous hypotheses: using journal rank as an assessment tool is bad scientific practice. Moreover, the data lead us to argue that any journal rank (not only the currently-favored Impact Factor) would have this negative impact. Therefore, we suggest that abandoning journals altogether, in favor of a library-based scholarly communication system, will ultimately be necessary. This new system will use modern information technology to vastly improve the filter, sort and discovery functions of the current journal system.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To develop a generic French self-administered instrument for measuring hospitalized patients' satisfaction based on the patient's point of view: the questionnaire for satisfaction of hospitalized ({QSH}) patients. {DESIGN}: The development was supervised by a steering committee and undertaken through three standard steps. Item generation was derived from 95 face-to-face interviews, performed in hospitalized patients and in patients scheduled to be admitted. The item reduction led to a 69-item questionnaire. The validation process was based on validity, reliability and some aspects of external validity. {SETTING}: Medical, surgical and obstetrical departments (n = 187) of public hospitals (n = 11) from different French regions (n = 3). {PARTICIPANTS}: Eligible patients were adult subjects hospitalized for at least 24 h. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: {QSH}, sociodemographic data, hospitalization department, visual analogue scales of satisfaction. {RESULTS}: The final version of {QSH} contained 45 items describing 9 dimensions, leading to 2 composite scores (staff and structure index). The factor structure accounted for 71\% of the total variance. Internal consistency was satisfactory (item-internal consistency over 0.40; Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.76 to 0.96). The scalability was satisfactory with inlier-sensitive fit ({INFIT}) statistics inside an acceptable range. Scores of dimensions were strongly positively correlated with visual analogue scale scores (all P {\textless} 0.001). External validity showed statistical associations between {QSH} scores and age or department. Participation rate was 91\%. {CONCLUSIONS}: The availability of a reliable and valid French questionnaire concerning hospitalized patients' satisfaction, exclusively generated from patients' interviews, enables patient feedback to be incorporated in a continuous quality health-care improvement strategy.},

Lesions of the dentate gyrus or the {CA}3, but not the {CA}1, subregion of the hippocampus induced a deficit in the acquisition of the task with short-term delays (i.e., 10 sec) and impaired performance of the task in a novel environment. All subregional lesions produced sustained impairment in performing the task with intermediate-term delays (i.e., 5 min) when rats were tested in a familiar environment. The results suggest a dynamic interaction among the dorsal hippocampal subregions in processing spatial working memory, with the time window (i.e., delay) of a task recognized as an essential controlling factor.},

	abstract = {Objective: To describe and discuss the process used to write a narrative review of the literature for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Publication of narrative overviews of the literature should be standardized to increase their objectivity. Background: In the past decade numerous changes in research methodology pertaining to reviews of the literature have occurred. These changes necessitate authors of review articles to be familiar with current standards in the publication process. Methods: Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of literature retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts. Discussion: An overview of the use of three types of reviews of the literature is presented. Step by step instructions for how to conduct and write a narrative overview utilizing a 'best-evidence synthesis' approach are discussed, starting with appropriate preparatory work and ending with how to create proper illustrations. Several resources for creating reviews of the literature are presented and a narrative overview critical appraisal worksheet is included. A bibliography of other useful reading is presented in an appendix. Conclusion: Narrative overviews can be a valuable contribution to the literature if prepared properly. New and experienced authors wishing to write a narrative overview should find this article useful in constructing such a paper and carrying out the research process. It is hoped that this article will stimulate scholarly dialog amongst colleagues about this research design and other complex literature review methods. ?? 2006 National University of Health Sciences.},

	abstract = {The frequency with which scientists fabricate and falsify data, or commit other forms of scientific misconduct is a matter of controversy. Many surveys have asked scientists directly whether they have committed or know of a colleague who committed research misconduct, but their results appeared difficult to compare and synthesize. This is the first meta-analysis of these surveys. To standardize outcomes, the number of respondents who recalled at least one incident of misconduct was calculated for each question, and the analysis was limited to behaviours that distort scientific knowledge: fabrication, falsification, "cooking" of data, etc... Survey questions on plagiarism and other forms of professional misconduct were excluded. The final sample consisted of 21 surveys that were included in the systematic review, and 18 in the meta-analysis. A pooled weighted average of 1.97\% (N = 7, 95\%{CI}: 0.86-4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once--a serious form of misconduct by any standard--and up to 33.7\% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12\% (N = 12, 95\% {CI}: 9.91-19.72) for falsification, and up to 72\% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words "falsification" or "fabrication", and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others. Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Previous research on educational data has demonstrated that Rasch fit statistics (mean squares and t-statistics) are highly susceptible to sample size variation for dichotomously scored rating data, although little is known about this relationship for polytomous data. These statistics help inform researchers about how well items fit to a unidimensional latent trait, and are an important adjunct to modern psychometrics. Given the increasing use of Rasch models in health research the purpose of this study was therefore to explore the relationship between fit statistics and sample size for polytomous data.

{METHODS}: Data were collated from a heterogeneous sample of cancer patients (n = 4072) who had completed both the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Ten samples were drawn with replacement for each of eight sample sizes (n = 25 to n = 3200). The Rating and Partial Credit Models were applied and the mean square and t-fit statistics (infit/outfit) derived for each model.

{RESULTS}: The results demonstrated that t-statistics were highly sensitive to sample size, whereas mean square statistics remained relatively stable for polytomous data.

{CONCLUSION}: It was concluded that mean square statistics were relatively independent of sample size for polytomous data and that misfit to the model could be identified using published recommended ranges.},

Among positive traits, Positivity ({POS}), defined as a general disposition conducive to facing experience under a positive outlook has shown robust associations with psychological health. Thus, the present study investigated the extent to which {POS} is able to predict (i) relapse after quitting smoking and (ii) the desire to smoke again. All participants (481) had previously attended a Group Counselling Program ({GCP}) for Smoking Cessation (from 2005 through 2010). They were contacted through telephone interview. Among participants, 244 were ex-smokers (age: years 56.3 ± 10.08, 52\% female) and 237 were still-smokers (age: years 55.0 ± 9.63; 63.5\% female). The association of {POS} with "craving to smoke" levels was assessed with multivariate linear regression analysis while controlling also for important differences in personality such as conscientiousness and general self-efficacy, as well as for gender and age. Results showed that {POS} was significantly and negatively associated with smoking status and with craving to smoke. Among covariates (i.e., conscientiousness, generalized self-efficacy), gender was associated with smoking status and with craving to smoke. Altogether these findings corroborate the idea that {POS} plays a significant role in sustaining individuals' efforts to quit smoking.},

These techniques were characterized as indirect rather than direct tactics of self-presentation because they can be seen to influence one's image in the eyes of observers, not through the direct presentation of information about oneself but rather through the presentation of positive or negative information about something with which one is merely associated. In both experiments, it was found that after experiencing a visible personal failure, subjects enhanced the asserted quality of their home university (basking) and devalued the asserted quality of a rival university (blasting). Further, Experi- ment 2 showed that conditions designed to produce increasing levels of image damage resulted in increasing amounts of subsequent basking and blasting. It is suggested that because of a tendency within observers for cognitive balance, individuals highly desirous of increased public prestige arrange to be positively connected with positive things and negatively connected with negative things in the observers' eyes. Implications of these findings for the area of intergroup relations are discussed},

In three independent studies, the factor structure of the Langer Mindfulness/Mindlessness Scale was examined. Confirmatory factor analysis failed to replicate the four-factor model and a subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed the presence of a two-factor (mindfulness and mindlessness) solution. Study 2 demonstrated that the two factors assessed discrete constructs and were not merely products of acquiescence. Support was also found for a nine-item, one-factor model comprised solely of mindfulness items. On comparing models, Study 3 suggested the superiority of the one-factor mindfulness model. Finally, a preliminary investigation of the concurrent validity of the revised nine-item Langer Mindfulness/Mindlessness Scale is presented. The current article offers researchers a revised version of a mindfulness measure derived from a cognitive perspective.

Specifically, 4 experiments established that priming the stereotype of professors or the trait intelligent enhanced participants' performance on a scale measuring general knowledge. Also, priming the stereotype of soccer hooligans or the trait stupid reduced participants' performance on a general knowledge scale. Results of the experiments revealed (a) that prolonged priming leads to more pronounced behavioral effects and (b) that there is no sign of decay of the effects for at least 15 min. The authors explain their results by claiming that perception had a direct and pervasive impact on overt behavior (cf. J.A. Bargh, M. Chen, \& L. Burrows, 1996).

This essay presents a current perspective on the three major topics of our joint work: heuristics of judgment, risky choice, and framing effects. In all three domains we studied intuitions -- thoughts and preferences that come to mind quickly and without much re- flection. I review the older research and some recent developments in light of two ideas that have become central to social-cognitive psychology in the in- tervening decades: the notion that thoughts differ in a dimension of accessi- bility -- some come to mind much more easily than others -- and the distinc- tion between intuitive and deliberate thought processes.},

Coronal images at four different locations in the occipital cortex were acquired during each of eight 12-s picture presentation periods (on) and 12-s interpicture interval (off). The extent of functional activation was larger in the right than the left hemisphere and larger in the occipital than in the occipitoparietal regions during processing of all picture contents compared with the interpicture intervals. More importantly, functional activity was significantly greater in all sampled brain regions when processing emotional (pleasant or unpleasant) pictures than when processing neutral stimuli. In Experiment 2, a hypothesis that these differences were an artifact of differential eye movements was ruled out. Whereas both emotional and neutral pictures produced activity centered on the calcarine fissure (Area 17), only emotional pictures also produced sizable clusters bilaterally in the occipital gyrus, in the right fusiform gyrus, and in the right inferior and superior parietal lobules.},

To this end, we present a provisional list of 50 commonly used terms in psychology, psychiatry, and allied fields that should be avoided, or at most used sparingly and with explicit caveats. We provide corrective information for students, instructors, and researchers regarding these terms, which we organize for expository purposes into five categories: inaccurate or misleading terms, frequently misused terms, ambiguous terms, oxymorons, and pleonasms. For each term, we (a) explain why it is problematic, (b) delineate one or more examples of its misuse, and (c) when pertinent, offer recommendations for preferable terms. By being more judicious in their use of terminology, psychologists and psychiatrists can foster clearer thinking in their students and the field at large regarding mental phenomena.},

	abstract = {Longitudinal study designs in biomedical research are motivated by the need or desire of a researcher to assess the change over time of an outcome and what risk factors may be associated with the outcome. The outcome is measured repeatedly over time for every individual in the study, and risk factors may be measured repeatedly over time or they may be static. For example, many clinical studies involving chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) use pulmonary function as a primary outcome and measure it repeatedly over time for each individual. There are many issues, both practical and theoretical, which make the analysis of longitudinal data complicated. Fortunately, advances in statistical theory and computer tech- nology over the past two decades have made techniques for the analysis of longitudinal data more readily available for data analysts. The aim of this paper is to provide a discussion of the important features of longitudinal data and review two popular modern statistical techniques used in biomedical research for the analy- sis of longitudinal data: the general linear mixed model, and generalized estimating equations. Examples are provided, using the study of pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis research.},

	abstract = {Demonstrates how one area of behavioral decision research, concerned with judgmental heuristics and biases, can contribute to an understanding of strategic decision-making, and in doing so has the potential to improve this aspect of organizational activity. Heuristic modes of thinking and general cognitive biases in decision and judgment are addressed. The authors also review and evaluate research regarding judgmental heuristics on strategic decision-making. It is stated that, overall, evidence supports the view that heuristic modes of thinking, and their attendant biases, are important features of strategic decision-making. The findings reviewed demonstrate that behavioral decision research can make an important contribution to the understanding of strategic management by identifying and explaining fundamental limitations of strategic thinking and reasoning, thereby adding to a growing body of psychological research concerned with the nature and impact of cognition and emotion in strategic management.

Subjects are given an individual endowment and vote by majority rule to either keep the endowment for private use or to donate it to a non-governmental organization. In our experiment, participants are divided at random in two treatments. Individuals in both treatments are provided with true yet diverging information regarding the approval rates observed in previous experimental sessions. Our results show that the voting behavior differs across treatments in a way that is consistent with bandwagon voting. They also confirm the importance of instrumental motives and -- unlike the majority of previous experiments -- find support for expressive voting motives. Finally, we assess the impact of the false-consensus effect from a theoretical perspective. We show that it has the potential to change voter behavior if it results from an anchoring bias and voters follow non-instrumental motives.},

We measured the effect of three cognitive tasks (the psychomotor vigilance task, a temporal orienting task, and a duration discrimination task) on the heart rate variability of two groups of participants: a high-fit group and a low-fit group. Two major novel findings emerged from this study. First, the lowest values of heart rate variability were found during performance of the duration discrimination task, compared to the other two tasks. Second, the results showed a decrement in heart rate variability as a function of the time on task, although only in the low-fit group. Moreover, the high-fit group showed overall faster reaction times than the low-fit group in the psychomotor vigilance task, while there were not significant differences in performance between the two groups of participants in the other two cognitive tasks. In sum, our results highlighted the influence of cognitive processing on heart rate variability. Importantly, both behavioral and physiological results suggested that the main benefit obtained as a result of fitness level appeared to be associated with processes involving sustained attention.},

{DATA} {SOURCES}: Cochrane systematic reviews and systematic reviews in paper based journals.

{STUDY} {SELECTION}: 965 systematic reviews (809 Cochrane reviews and 156 paper based reviews) published between 1995 and 2002.

{DATA} {SYNTHESIS}: The methodological quality of primary studies was assessed in 854 of the 965 systematic reviews (88.5\%). This occurred more often in Cochrane reviews than in paper based reviews (93.9\% v 60.3\%, P {\textless} 0.0001). Overall, only 496 (51.4\%) used the quality assessment in the analysis and interpretation of the results or in their discussion, with no significant differences between Cochrane reviews and paper based reviews (52\% v 49\%, P = 0.58). The tools and methods used for quality assessment varied widely.

{CONCLUSIONS}: Cochrane reviews fared better than systematic reviews published in paper based journals in terms of assessment of methodological quality of primary studies, although they both largely failed to take it into account in the interpretation of results. Methods for assessment of methodological quality by systematic reviews are still in their infancy and there is substantial room for improvement.},

The world seems to divide into "creatives" and "noncreatives," and too many people resign themselves to the latter category. And yet we know that creativity is essential to success in any discipline or industry. The good news, according to authors Tom Kelley and David Kelley of {IDEO}, is that we all can rediscover our creative confidence. The trick is to overcome the four big fears that hold most of us back: fear of the messy unknown, fear of judgment, fear of the first step, and fear of losing control. The authors use an approach based on the work of psychologist Albert Bandura in helping patients get over their snake phobias: You break challenges down into small steps and then build confidence by succeeding on one after another.

The size distributions of casualties both in whole wars from 1816 to 1980 and terrorist attacks have separately been shown to follow approximate power-law distributions. However, the possibility of universal patterns ranging across wars in the size distribution or timing of within-conflict events has barely been explored. Here we show that the sizes and timing of violent events within different insurgent conflicts exhibit remarkable similarities. We propose a unified model of human insurgency that reproduces these commonalities, and explains conflict-specific variations quantitatively in terms of underlying rules of engagement. Our model treats each insurgent population as an ecology of dynamically evolving, self-organized groups following common decision-making processes. Our model is consistent with several recent hypotheses about modern insurgency, is robust to many generalizations, and establishes a quantitative connection between human insurgency, global terrorism and ecology. Its similarity to financial market models provides a surprising link between violent and non-violent forms of human behaviour.},

Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

	abstract = {Debate has emerged in the literature on mania, with some evidence suggesting that tendencies toward mania relate to negative emotional and cognitive styles, and other evidence suggesting that tendencies toward mania relate to positive emotional and cognitive styles. An initial study examined how tendencies toward mania (as measured by the Hypomanic Personality Scale) and tendencies toward depression (as measured by the Inventory to Diagnose Depression-Lifetime version) were related to diverse measures pertaining to incentive and threat motivations, negative and positive emotionality, and cognitive responses to emotion, among 238 undergraduates. Tendencies toward mania related to a self-reported pattern of reacting intensely to positive stimuli, both cognitively and emotionally, as well as lower sensitivity to threatening stimuli and less restraint over impulses. In contrast, tendencies toward depression related to a pattern of reacting more strongly to negative stimuli emotionally and cognitively, as well as deficits in the ability to savor positive affect. This pattern was re-confirmed in a second sample of 394 undergraduates, who completed many of the same measures plus a measure of current mood symptoms. This second sample confirmed that the pattern was not mood-state dependent. Implications for future research and clinical work are discussed, including an intriguing conceptual parallel in the distinct sets of correlates of depressive versus manic tendencies.},

	abstract = {This study examined whether the individual capacity for self-control (as a psychological resource) moderates (i.e., buffers) the adverse influences of self-control demands (as a psychological work stressor) on employees' perceived job strain and well-being. To our knowledge this relationship has not previously been studied. In line with the match principle proposed by de Jonge and Dormann (2006), it was assumed that this moderator effect was most likely to emerge in psychological outcomes, whereas physical outcomes were expected to reflect no equivalent relationships. Data collected from 249 health care workers employed in an area of Eastern Germany confirmed both hypotheses. Psychological outcomes (such as emotional exhaustion, depressive symptoms and sleep disorders) clearly indicated that the detrimental impacts of self-control demands are attenuated with an increase in self-control capacity. By way of contrast, musculoskeletal complaints as a physical outcome, which was mainly included as a control variable, failed to reflect any effects of both predictors. Our findings draw attention to the importance of improving the match between self-control demands and self-control capacity of service employees in order to make self-control demands less stressful.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To describe the development and initial validation of the self-administered Client Perceptions of Coordination Questionnaire. {DESIGN}: The instrument was developed between 1996 and 1997 through iterative item generation; within a framework of six domains of coordination, addressed across four sectors of health care provision. {SETTING}: 1193 individuals with complex and chronic health care needs as judged by their general practitioners ({GPs}), who were participants in a 2-year randomized controlled trial of a coordinated care intervention in Australia. Other samples were collected in one general practice (98) and from attendees of a chronic pain management course (29). {MAIN} {MEASURES}: Face and content validity, completion rates, transferability, internal consistency, and construct validity of the 32-item instrument. {RESULTS}: Most items achieved excellent completion and comprehension rates. The instrument was transferable to another chronically unwell population. Cronbach's alpha of the entire instrument was 0.92, and for six individual scales scores ranged from 0.31 to 0.86. The six scales based on principal components analysis were acceptability, received care, {GP}, nominated provider, client comprehension, and client capacity. The first four scales were satisfactory, but the client scales were inadequate with poor internal consistency, and convergent and discriminant validity. People with chronic pain syndromes had significantly worse experiences for almost all items, supporting construct validity. {CONCLUSION}: This instrument is one of the first to attempt to measure coordination of health care. Its strengths include ease of completion, transferability, and promising psychometric properties and construct validity. Problems capturing data about the patient's contribution to coordination highlight a lack of theoretical development in this area. A valid measure of coordination should be useful in needs assessment, program evaluation, and individual provider/practice audit, and would contribute to research into the experience and measurement of patient-focused care.},

In 5 experiments, participants received greedy, equal, or generous divisions of money or labor from an anonymous person and then divided additional resources with a new anonymous person. While equal treatment was paid forward in kind, greed was paid forward more than generosity. This asymmetry was driven by negative affect, such that a positive affect intervention disrupted the tendency to pay greed forward. Implications for models of generalized reciprocity are discussed.},

	abstract = {An object moving towards an observer is subjectively perceived as longer in duration than the same object that is static or moving away. This "time dilation effect" has been shown for a number of stimuli that differ from standard events along different feature dimensions (e.g. color, size, and dynamics). We performed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) study, while subjects viewed a stream of five visual events, all of which were static and of identical duration except the fourth one, which was a deviant target consisting of either a looming or a receding disc. The duration of the target was systematically varied and participants judged whether the target was shorter or longer than all other events. A time dilation effect was observed only for looming targets. Relative to the static standards, the looming as well as the receding targets induced increased activation of the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortices (the "core control network"). The decisive contrast between looming and receding targets representing the time dilation effect showed strong asymmetric activation and, specifically, activation of cortical midline structures (the "default network"). These results provide the first evidence that the illusion of temporal dilation is due to activation of areas that are important for cognitive control and subjective awareness. The involvement of midline structures in the temporal dilation illusion is interpreted as evidence that time perception is related to self-referential processing.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

In this article, we compare the predictive validity of personality traits with that of socioeconomic status ({SES}) and cognitive ability to test the relative contribution of personality traits to predictions of three critical outcomes: mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment. Only evidence from prospective longitudinal studies was considered. In addition, an attempt was made to limit the review to studies that controlled for important background factors. Results showed that the magnitude of the effects of personality traits on mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment was indistinguishable from the effects of {SES} and cognitive ability on these outcomes. These results demonstrate the influence of personality traits on important life outcomes, highlight the need to more routinely incorporate measures of personality into quality of life surveys, and encourage further research about the developmental origins of personality traits and the processes by which these traits influence diverse life outcomes.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Data on endoscopic resection of sporadic duodenal adenoma ({SDA}) are sparse; wepresent our results concerning safety and effi− cacy in a retrospective analysis of saline−assisted endoscopic resection of {SDA}. Patients and methods: The cases of all patients who underwent endoscopic resection for {SDA} be− tween May 1998 and May 2006 were analyzed. Endoscopic resection was carried out using standard injection and cut methods. In some pa− tients hemoclips and argon plasma coagulation were used, either for prophylaxis or for the treat− ment of procedure−related bleeding. Results: Thirty−six patients with a total of 37 le− sions (mean size 19mm, range 4?50mm) were analyzed. Lesions larger than 20mm were more frequently resected piecemeal (P = 0.022). Intra− procedural bleeding occurred in 14\% of cases, without any significant association with lesion size or the resection technique. One fatal perforation occurred. Macroscopically complete resec− tion was achieved in 97\% of cases, as confirmed by at least one negative control endoscopy with biopsies after a mean follow−up of 15 months. Al− though clipping and argon plasma coagulation were not applied in any systematic way, it was noticeable that in the 20 cases in which they were used for hemostasis or prevention, no de− layed bleeding was observed after the proce− dures. In contrast, bleeding occurred in 22\% of the 23 procedures performed without these ad− ditional techniques. Conclusion: Endoscopic resection is an efficient and acceptably safe technique for treating {SDA}. Further studies need to assess whether systema− tic bleeding prophylaxis will reduce the inci− dence of delayed hemorrhage after endoscopic resection.},

In the absence of trust among trading partners, market transactions break down. In the absence of trust in a country's institutions and leaders, political legitimacy breaks down. Much recent evidence indicates that trust contributes to economic, political and social success. Little is known, however, about the biological basis of trust among humans. Here we show that intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that plays a key role in social attachment and affiliation in non-human mammals, causes a substantial increase in trust among humans, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions. We also show that the effect of oxytocin on trust is not due to a general increase in the readiness to bear risks. On the contrary, oxytocin specifically affects an individual's willingness to accept social risks arising through interpersonal interactions. These results concur with animal research suggesting an essential role for oxytocin as a biological basis of prosocial approach behaviour.},

In addition, to use background factors to create less biased ranking in comparisons of patient satisfaction between medical specialities. {DESIGN}: A questionnaire was sent by post to patients who had recently received inpatient care at a hospital within the County of Ostergötland, Sweden. The questionnaire contained 33 questions, 21 of which concerned the quality of health care and patient satisfaction. {SETTING}: Inpatient departments at all four hospitals in the County of Ostergötland, Sweden. {SUBJECTS}: All patients discharged from the hospital during a period of 6 weeks. Approximately 3400 patients aged 1-94 years responded to the questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 69\%. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Patient satisfaction index score ({PSI}). {RESULTS}: Of the background factors tested, patient age had the greatest explanatory value regarding the {PSI}, closely followed by experiencing anxiety during admission. With regard to variations in the {PSI}, about 20\% could be explained by the background factors taken as a whole. Gender did not correlate with the {PSI}, although males were somewhat more satisfied than females. {PSI} scores differed among medical specialities and, interestingly, when age and other background factors were controlled for, the picture changed regarding the medical speciality that received the best {PSI} score. {CONCLUSION}: The change in ranking among medical specialities after adjustment for background factors emphasizes the importance of including background factors in patient satisfaction analyses in order to obtain less biased comparisons.},

	abstract = {A substantial body of evidence collected by Batson and his associates has advanced the idea that pure (i.e., selfless) altruism occurs under conditions of empathy for a needy other. An egoistic alternative account of this evidence was proposed and tested in our work. We hypothesized that an observer's heightened empathy for a sufferer brings with it increased personal sadness in the observer and that it is the egoistic desire to relieve the sadness, rather than the selfless desire to relieve the sufferer, that motivates helping. Two experiments contrasted predictions from the selfless and egoistic alternatives in the paradigm typically used by Batson and his associates. In the first, an emphatic orientation to a victim increased personal sadness, as expected. Furthermore, when sadness and empathic emotion were separated experimentally, helping was predicted by the levels of sadness subjects were experiencing but not by their empathy scores. In the second experiment, enhanced sadness was again associated with empathy for a victim. However, subjects who were led to perceive that their moods could not be altered through helping (because of the temporary action of a "mood-fixing" placebo drug) were not helpful, despite high levels of empathic emotion. The results were interpreted as providing support for an egoistically based interpretation of helping under conditions of high empathy.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Freund and Schapire[1996]), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {In problem solving, as in street fighting, rules are for fools: do whatever works---don't just stand there! Yet we often fear an unjustified leap even though it may land us on a correct result. Traditional mathematics teaching is largely about solving exactly stated problems exactly, yet life often hands us partly defined problems needing only moderately accurate solutions. This engaging book is an antidote to the rigor mortis brought on by too much mathematical rigor, teaching us how to guess answers without needing a proof or an exact calculation. In Street-Fighting Mathematics, Sanjoy Mahajan builds, sharpens, and demonstrates tools for educated guessing and down-and-dirty, opportunistic problem solving across diverse fields of knowledge---from mathematics to management. Mahajan describes six tools: dimensional analysis, easy cases, lumping, picture proofs, successive approximation, and reasoning by analogy. Illustrating each tool with numerous examples, he carefully separates the tool---the general principle---from the particular application so that the reader can most easily grasp the tool itself to use on problems of particular interest. Street-Fighting Mathematics grew out of a short course taught by the author at {MIT} for students ranging from first-year undergraduates to graduate students ready for careers in physics, mathematics, management, electrical engineering, computer science, and biology. They benefited from an approach that avoided rigor and taught them how to use mathematics to solve real problems.

About the Author Sanjoy Mahajan studied mathematics at the University of Oxford and received a {PhD} in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology. He is now Associate Director of the Teaching and Learning Laboratory and a Lecturer in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at {MIT}.

In light of these puzzling results, I propose that the relationship between extraversion and sales performance is not linear but curvilinear: Ambiverts achieve greater sales productivity than extraverts or introverts do. Because they naturally engage in a flexible pattern of talking and listening, ambiverts are likely to express sufficient assertiveness and enthusiasm to persuade and close a sale but are more inclined to listen to customers' interests and less vulnerable to appearing too excited or overconfident. A study of 340 outbound-call-center representatives supported the predicted inverted-U-shaped relationship between extraversion and sales revenue. This research presents a fresh perspective on the personality traits that facilitate successful influence and offers novel insights for people in choosing jobs and for organizations in hiring and training employees.},

	title = {Haben oder Sein},
	url = {http://www.amazon.de/Haben-oder-Sein-Erich-Fromm/dp/3423361034},
	abstract = {{TextbfDie} Macht der Hilfsverben Ja doch, die Welt ver ndern. Das wollte er und sch mte sich nicht daf r, vom Haben und vom Sein schrieb er und von der Chance, die es gebe, der Diktatur des Habens zu entfliehen, er schrieb es in einer Zeit, als das h ssliche Wort Gutmenschentum noch nicht erfunden war, das heute alles zu ersticken vermag, was nach utopischem Denken klingt. Es war 1976, als Haben oder Sein`` erschien, das Jahr der Dioxin-Katastrophe in Seveso, das Jahr der ersten gro en Brokdorf-Demonstration: Der Psychoanalytiker, Philosoph, Sozialforscher Erich Fromm, 1900 geboren, schrieb sein sp tes Werk hinein in eine Zeit, die sehr empf nglich daf r war. Jene Zeit, als auf B cherregalen die blauen Marx-Engels-B nde zur Seite ger ckt wurden, um Platz zu schaffen f r die Texte der Frauen-, der Schwulen-, der Alternativbewegung; als die Bibliografien geisteswissenschaftlicher Werke zwangsl ufig mit A wie Adorno begannen; Fromm stand nicht in jeder Literaturliste, doch im Gegensatz zu Adorno, seinem Mitstreiter und Rivalen aus dem legend ren Frankfurter Institut f r Sozialforschung, wurde er tats chlich gelesen. Gelesen und zitiert und zu Tode paraphrasiert, seine Kunst des Liebens`` vor allem, 1956 erschienen und millionenfach verkauft. Nicht klammern, loslassen, zu sich selber finden, jenes Siebziger-Jahre-Begleitgemurmel f r Beziehungsdiskussion und Gesellschaftsanalyse, h ufig fand es seine Quellen in den Schriften des Sozialwissenschaftlers Fromm, was ihm den Ruf des weichgesp lten Kuschelphilosophen verschaffte, den man schlie lich nicht mehr lesen mochte, sehr zu Unrecht, wie ein frischer Blick auf sein Werk erschlie t. Haben oder Sein - Die seelischen Grundlagen einer neuen Gesellschaft`` schrieb er im Tessin lebend, nach Europa zur ckgekehrt aus jahrzehntelangem Exil in Mexiko und den {USA}, den ersten Herzinfarkt hatte er hinter sich, es blieb sein letzter gro er Text. Haben und Sein - zwei substantivierte Verben, aus denen eine Weltsicht entsteht. Zwei Menschentypen, zwei Gesellschaftstypen besiedeln die Welt: Das Haben entspricht dem Geist einer nekrophilen Gesellschaft, die tote Dinge verehrt, w hrend die biophile Gesellschaft des Seins den Menschen als ihren Mittelpunkt begreift. Fromm schrieb das in eine Zeit hinein, die begann, ber die Grenzen des Wachstums`` zu diskutieren, der erste Bericht des Club of Rome war erschienen, das britische Atomkraftwerk Sellafield, war knapp an einer Katastrophe vorbeigeschrammt, er schrieb es in einer Welt des Habens, so befand er, die ihre Lebensgrundlagen vernichtet und sich nur ndern kann, wenn sich auch die Psyche des Menschen ndert, der in ihr lebt. Scharfsichtig und sehr aktuell seine Analyse des Marketing-Charakters`` des modernen Menschen, schon in den vierziger Jahren hat er sie entwickelt, nun f hrt er sie n her aus: Alles ist abgestellt auf vor bergehende Befriedigung, auf Verschlei . Der Konsument, jener ewige S ugling, der nach der Flasche schreit``, kennzeichnet diese Welt des Habens, kurzfristig nur identifiziert er sich mit modernen Gebrauchsgegenst nden, deren wesentliche Eigenschaft es ist, berholt und beseitigt zu werden. Alles ist austauschbar, Dinge, Meinungen, Einstellungen, Freunde, Liebespartner, und der Mensch selbst beginnt sein konstantes Selbst einzub en, wird zur Ware auf dem Pers nlichkeitsmarkt``, die sich vorteilhaft pr sentieren muss, die sich selbst verkauft: Ich bin, was ich habe, und was ich habe, hat mich. Als Vision setzt er dagegen eine Welt des Seins. Aus Marx und Buddha und Jesus und Freud speist sich diese Vision, dazu Spinoza und Meister Eckhart, er sagt: Es gibt Hoffnung, die Welt ist ver nderbar. Fromm ist der Erfinder der Analytischen Sozialphilosophie, er war von 1930 an Mitarbeiter in Max Horkheimers Institut f r Sozialforschung und bis zum Zerw rfnis im Exil in den sp ten drei iger Jahren eine der pr genden Pers nlichkeiten der Frankfurter Schule, und er hat eine andere Botschaft als die pessimistische seiner Kollegen. Sp ttisch zitiert wurde im Institut gern ein Spruch, der ihn seit seiner Jugend begleitete: Lieber Gott, mach mich wie Erich Fromm, dass ich in den Himmel komm.`` Was ungerecht ist, denn Fromm sagt nicht: Alles wird gut. Er sagt, dass die Chancen gering bleiben, da es zu den notwendigen menschlichen und gesellschaftlichen Ver nderungen kommt``. Aber er sagt auch, beides sei im Menschen angelegt, das Sein und das Haben, und stark beeinflusst werde er durch den Charakter der Gesellschaft, in der er lebt. Beides m sse ver ndert werden, der Mensch und die Gesellschaft, und bei beidem lohne der Versuch - was ermutigender klingt als die Botschaft Adornos, derzufolge es kein richtiges Leben im falschen geben kann. Konturen der k nftigen Gesellschaft hat Fromm entworfen, manches davon wirkt wie im 21. Jahrhundert verfasst, der Aufruf zum Verbraucherboykott als gesellschaftspolitischem Druckmittel beispielsweise, die Forderung nach einem garantierten j hrlichen Mindesteinkommen f r jeden B rger, das liest sich wie Beitr ge zu den aktuellen Debatten der Republik. Anderes erscheint merkw rdig heute, abwegiger, seine Idee beispielsweise, einen Kulturrat`` ins Leben zu rufen, ein Gremium aus Vertretern der geistigen und k nstlerischen Elite des Landes, aus M nnern und Frauen, deren Integrit t ber jeden Zweifel erhaben ist`` - w rde man sie finden? Oder die Idee, ein System zur Verbreitung von echten Fakten und alternativen Denkans tzen, von objektiven Informationen`` zu etablieren - gibt es die? Es ist mehr der Blick aufs Ganze, der bei Fromm fasziniert, sein Ansatz, nicht nur das Individuum, sondern die Gesellschaft mit dem Blick des Psychoanalytikers zu studieren, und einer der interessantesten Aspekte daran ist sein Umgang mit dem Begriff Religion``. Fromm, ein Kind aus j disch-orthodoxem Hause, der sich, als er die Psychoanalyse entdeckt hat, entfernt von der Orthodoxie - er ist der Meinung, dass jede Gesellschaft eine Grundkonstante hat, ohne die sie nicht funktioniert: Sie muss das allen Menschen eigene religi se Bed rfnis erf llen``. Er meint nicht ein Glaubenssystem, das notwendigerweise mit einem Gottesbegriff operiert. Er meint jedes System des Denkens und Handelns, das dem Einzelnen einen Rahmen der Orientierung und ein Objekt der Hingabe bietet``. Hingabe an B ume, an Idole aus Gold, einen unsichtbaren Gott. An eine Nation, an eine Klasse, eine Partei, an eine ungefesselte Marktwirtschaft, an Geld oder Erfolg, all das ist f r ihn Religion, er fragt nicht Religion oder nicht Religion``, er fragt welche Religion``, und ob sie einen zerst rerischen Charakter f r die menschliche Gesellschaft hat. Er stellt die Ketzerfrage, ob die westliche Gesellschaft wirklich so christlich ist, wie sie sich d nkt - ihn erinnert die Verkl rung des Wettstreits, des Siegenm ssens in der Marktwirtschaft nicht an die Botschaft Jesu, unser Vorbild, sagt er, ist immer noch der heidnische Held``. Seine eigene Religion, die des radikalen Humanismus``, mag manchem gestrig erscheinen. Sie ist es nicht. Nachwort von Barbara Supp zu {emphHaben} oder Sein. {SPIEGEL}-Edition Band 28},

Using the Rasch rating scale model analysis, the Grasmick et al. scale is evaluated for construct validity in a college student sample. The results show that the 4-point Likert-type formal response categories are not suitable for the scale. The distribution of the measures does not align with the distribution of the item measures in the original Grasmick et al. scale. The items do not fit the Rasch model, they do not form a unidimensional trait, and they function differently for males and females. Thus, the original Grasmick et al. scale does not have construct validity. A revised scale is presented that meets the standards of the Rasch model.},

Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy. 1.

The possible mechanisms of action and active ingredients of psychotherapy in children and adolescents are discussed, with an emphasis on the above-noted domains. The adult psychotherapy literature strongly supports the central roles of the therapeutic relationship and therapeutic empathy; this has been much less intensively explored in the child and adolescent psychotherapy literature. Similarly, there have been few studies examining the mediation of treatment effects by impact on specific domains. Ideally, treatment studies should gather data that can be informative about the impact of putative mediating and moderating psychosocial and biological variables on outcome and course. The results of such studies can aid further refinements in both theories of etiology and improvement in treatments for children and adolescents.},

No known studies have systematically reviewed and statistically integrated mediation studies in this field. The present study aimed to systematically review mediation studies in the literature on mindfulness-based interventions ({MBIs}), to identify potential psychological mechanisms underlying {MBCT} and {MBSR}'s effects on psychological functioning and wellbeing, and evaluate the strength and consistency of evidence for each mechanism. For the identified mechanisms with sufficient evidence, quantitative synthesis using two-stage meta-analytic structural equation modelling ({TSSEM}) was used to examine whether these mechanisms mediate the impact of {MBIs} on clinical outcomes. This review identified strong, consistent evidence for cognitive and emotional reactivity, moderate and consistent evidence for mindfulness, rumination, and worry, and preliminary but insufficient evidence for self-compassion and psychological flexibility as mechanisms underlying {MBIs}. {TSSEM} demonstrated evidence for mindfulness, rumination and worry as significant mediators of the effects of {MBIs} on mental health outcomes. Most reviewed mediation studies have several key methodological shortcomings which preclude robust conclusions regarding mediation. However, they provide important groundwork on which future studies could build.},

In line with social-norms theory, participants' level of unethical behavior increased when the confederate was an in-group member, but decreased when the confederate was an out-group member. In Experiment 2, our confederate instead asked a question about cheating, which merely strengthened the saliency of this possibility. This manipulation decreased the level of unethical behavior among the other group members.

It was found that positive emotional expressions on Facebook did not correlate with life satisfaction, whereas negative emotional expressions within the past 9--10 months (but not beyond) were significantly related to life satisfaction. These findings suggest that both the type of emotional expressions and the time frame of status updates determine whether emotional expressions in Facebook status updates can effectively reflect users' {SWB}.

	abstract = {We integrate dual-process theories of human cognition with evolutionary game theory to study the evolution of automatic and controlled decision-making processes. We introduce a model where agents who make decisions using either automatic or controlled processing compete with each other for survival. Agents using automatic processing act quickly and so are more likely to acquire resources, but agents using controlled processing are better planners and so make more effective use of the resources they have. Using the replicator equation, we characterize the conditions under which automatic or controlled agents dominate, when coexistence is possible, and when bistability occurs. We then extend the replicator equation to consider feedback between the state of the population and the environment. Under conditions where having a greater proportion of controlled agents either enriches the environment or enhances the competitive advantage of automatic agents, we find that limit cycles can occur, leading to persistent oscillations in the population dynamics. Critically, however, these limit cycles only emerge when feedback occurs on a sufficiently long time scale. Our results shed light on the connection between evolution and human cognition, and demonstrate necessary conditions for the rise and fall of rationality.},

Depending on the particular question being asked, cohort studies, case-control studies, or cross-sectional studies are conducted. {METHODS}: Methods of data analysis in different types of epidemiological studies are illustrated through examples with fictive data. Important measures of frequency and effect will be introduced. Different regression models will be presented as examples of complex analytical methods. {RESULTS}: Important frequency measures in cohort studies are incidence and mortality. Important effect measures such as the relative risk ({RR}), hazard ratio ({HR}), standardized incidence ratio ({SIR}), standardized mortality ratio ({SMR}), and odds ratio ({OR}) can also be calculated. In case-control or cross-sectional studies, the {OR} can be calculated as an effect measure. In cross-sectional studies, prevalence is the most important frequency measure. The interpretation of different frequency measures and effect measures will be discussed. {CONCLUSION}: The measures to be calculated and the analyses to be performed in an epidemiological study depend on the research questions being asked, the study type, and the available data.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to apply a novel economic tool (cost satisfaction analysis) to assess the utility of fixed prosthodontics, to review its applicability, and to explore the perceived value of treatment. The cost satisfaction analysis employed the validated Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire ({PSQ}). Patients with a known prostheses outcome over 1-20 years were mailed the {PSQ}. Five hundred patients (50˙7\%) responded. Remembered satisfaction at insertion (initial costs) and current satisfaction (costs in hindsight) were reported on {VAS}, and the difference calculated (costs with time). Percentage and grouped responses (low, {\textless}40\%; medium, 40-70\%; high, {\textgreater} 70\%) were analysed in relation to patient gender, age and willingness to have undergone the same treatment again, and in relation to prostheses age, type, complexity and outcome. Significance was set at P = 0˙05. Averages were reported as means ± standard error. Satisfaction with initial costs and costs in hindsight were unrelated to patient gender and age, and prostheses age, type and complexity. Patients with a failure and those who would elect to not undergo the same treatment again were significantly less satisfied with initial costs (P = 0˙021, P {\textless} 0˙001) and costs in hindsight (P = 0˙021, P {\textless} 0˙001) than their counterparts. Patient's cost satisfaction (entire cohort) had significantly improved from 53 ± 1\% at insertion to 81 ± 0˙9\% in hindsight (28 ± 1\% improvement, P {\textless} 0˙001). Patient cost satisfaction had also significantly improved, and the magnitude of improvement was the same within every individual cohort (P = 0˙004 to P {\textless} 0˙001), including patients with failures, and those who in hindsight would not undergo the same treatment again. Low satisfaction was reported by 166 patients initially, but 94\% of these reported improvements in hindsight. Fourteen patients (3\%) remained dissatisfied in hindsight, although 71\% of these would still choose to undergo the same treatment again. Cost satisfaction analysis provided an evaluation of the patient's perspective of the value of fixed prosthodontic treatment. Although fixed prosthodontic treatment was perceived by patients to be expensive, it was also perceived to impart value with time. Cost satisfaction analysis provides a clinically useful insight into patient behaviour.},

Here we show that employees of a large, international bank behave, on average, honestly in a control condition. However, when their professional identity as bank employees is rendered salient, a significant proportion of them become dishonest. This effect is specific to bank employees because control experiments with employees from other industries and with students showthat they do not becomemore dishonestwhen theirprofessional identity or bank-related items are rendered salient. Our results thus suggest that the prevailing business culture in the banking industry weakens and undermines the honesty norm, implying that measures to re-establish an honest culture are very important.},

	abstract = {The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ({GRADE}) working group represents an international collaboration of guideline developers, clinicians, health services researchers and methodologists. Many leading organizations, including the World Health Organization ({WHO}), use the {GRADE} approach because it has led to progress in the assessment of evidence and in the development of healthcare recommendations. The {GRADE} system distinguishes the quality of evidence from the strength of a recommendation. The quality of evidence reflects the extent of confidence that an estimate of effect is correct if it is used in the context of single endpoints. In the context of giving guidance, it reflects the extent to which confidence in an estimate of the effect is adequate to support recommendations. The strength of a recommendation, separated into strong and weak or conditional recommendations for or against an intervention, is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh the undesirable effects. A recommendation for action requires consideration for the magnitude of the expected benefit and downsides of an intervention for all patientimportant endpoints, the associate values and preferences and resource use. The {GRADE} system includes a systematic approach to evaluate the generalizability of study results to healthcare practice. Judgments about generalizability, better termed directness, are separated into judgments about the availability of direct comparisons between two alternative management strategies and judgments about differences between the population, intervention, comparator to the intervention, and outcomes ({PICO}) of interest for a given question, and those included in the relevant studies. In addition to providing an overview of the {GRADE} system, this article focuses on the approach to assessing directness or generalizability.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, there has been a trend in the social and economic sciences to pay closer attention to individual preferences and values in establishing the microanalytical foundations for a theory of human action. Following a series of socio-psychological expansions of the Socio-Economic Panel ({SOEP}) survey in recent years, the questionnaire was rounded out further in the year 2005 to include personality indicators. This recent addition was based on the “Big Five” approach, a psychological concept used to describe and study personality. Fundamental to this approach is the assumption that personality differences between indi- viduals, which are manifested in different ways of behaving and experiencing the world, can be traced back to five basic personality traits: Neuroticism (N), Extraversion (E), Openness to experience (O), Agreeableness (A) and Conscientiousness (C). A pretest was conducted in 2004 on a number of different short item scales to test the Big Five approach, with the goal of developing a useful and widely applicable short item scale ({BFI}-S) for the 2005 {SOEP} survey. The short inventory of questions developed in the present study, {BFI}-S, contains 15 items and can be completed within two minutes. The items in the individual scales display strong inter- nal coherence, and was conceptualized based on the five-factor structure of the Big Five. Additionally, {BFI}-S is also able to replicate the results of the 25-item {BFI} to a large extent. The reliability test that was conducted also produced a satisfactory overall result, and showed strong empirical indications for the validity of the personality concept of the Big Five em- ployed in {BFI}-S.},

	url = {https://osf.io/6durk},
	shorttitle = {When Psychometrics Fail},
	abstract = {The mass adoption of digital technologies continues to generate psychological debate on how they impact people and society. A considerable body work has observed associations between technology use and a variety of negative outcomes including depression, anxiety, sleep, and cognitive impairments. However, the debate is far from settled with large, pre-registered studies failing to replicate these controversial findings. Unifying much of this work is the reliance on subjective estimates or self-reported smartphone ‘usage’ scales. These have repeatedly failed to align with objective behavior. As with other areas of psychometric assessment, researchers may now ask themselves what are these scales are actually measuring? Across three studies, we first observe that the majority of highly cited scales have not been developed in line with best psychometric practice. Next, using a principal component analysis ({PCA}), we then demonstrate that many scales are likely to be measuring a single, identical construct. Finally, we demonstrate an overlap between these scales and mental health, using both latent relationship ({EFA}) and data reduction ({PCA}) perspectives. These findings help explain why negative associations will always appear between technology use and well-being when using these measures. Our results suggest that psychologists need to critically consider how they proceed both methodologically and conceptually when developing psychometric scales if research findings are to ever be drawn together into a coherent body of knowledge.},

	abstract = {Causal inference goes beyond prediction by modeling the outcome of interventions and formalizing counterfactual reasoning. Instead of restricting causal conclusions to experiments, causal inference explicates the conditions under which it is possible to draw causal conclusions even from observational data. In this paper, I provide a concise introduction to the graphical approach to causal inference, which uses Directed Acyclic Graphs ({DAGs}) to visualize, and Structural Causal Models ({SCMs}) to relate probabilistic and causal relationships. Successively, we climb what Judea Pearl calls the "causal hierarchy" --- moving from association to intervention to counterfactuals. I explain how {DAGs} can help us reason about associations between variables as well as interventions; how the do-calculus leads to a satisfactory definition of confounding, thereby clarifying, among other things, Simpson's paradox; and how {SCMs} enable us to reason about what could have been. Lastly, I discuss a number of challenges in applying causal inference in practice.},

By fitting models to experimental data we can probe the algorithms underlying behavior, find neural correlates of computational variables and better understand the effects of drugs, illness and interventions. But with great power comes great responsibility. Here, we offer ten simple rules to ensure that computational modeling is used with care and yields meaningful insights. In particular, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online. However, most rules apply to more advanced techniques. Our hope is that by following our guidelines, researchers will avoid many pitfalls and unleash the power of computational modeling on their own data.},

This paper argues that no such asymmetry has been empirically demonstrated, and that stifling debate around taboo topics can itself do active harm. To the extent that the paper’s argument has force, it cannot simply be taken for granted that, when in doubt, stifling debate around taboo topics is the ethical thing to do.},

	abstract = {The connection between race and intelligence has been a subject of debate in both popular science and academic research since the inception of {IQ} testing in the early 20th century. Since then, there have been observed differences between average {IQ} scores of different population groups, but whether and to what extent these differences reflect environmental factors as opposed to genetic ones, as well as what the definitions of "race" and "intelligence" are, and whether they can be objectively defined, is the subject of much debate. At present, there is no non-circumstantial evidence that these differences in test scores have a genetic component, although some researchers believe that the existing circumstantial evidence makes it at least plausible that hard evidence for a genetic component will eventually be found.
The first tests showing differences in {IQ} scores between different population groups in the United States were the tests of United States Army recruits in World War I. In the 1920s, groups of eugenics lobbyists argued that this demonstrated that African-Americans and certain immigrant groups were of inferior intellect to Anglo-Saxon white people, due to innate biological differences, using this as an argument for policies of racial segregation. However, soon, other studies appeared, contesting these conclusions and arguing instead that the Army tests had not adequately controlled for environmental factors, such as socio-economic and educational inequality between black people and white people. Later observations of phenomena such as the Flynn effect have also suggested that environmental factors play a greater role in group {IQ} differences than previously expected. 
The causes of differences in {IQ} test scores are not well-understood, and the topic remains controversial among researchers.},

Methods Data from over 138 million county-level tweets were analyzed using predictive modeling, differential language analysis, and mediating language analysis. Results Twitter language data captures cross-sectional patterns of excessive alcohol consumption beyond that of sociodemographic factors (e.g. age, gender, race, income, education), and can be used to accurately predict rates of excessive alcohol consumption. Additionally, mediation analysis found that Twitter topics (e.g. ‘ready gettin leave’) can explain much of the variance associated between socioeconomics and excessive alcohol consumption. Conclusions Twitter data can be used to predict public health concerns such as excessive drinking. Using mediation analysis in conjunction with predictive modeling allows for a high portion of the variance associated with socioeconomic status to be explained.},

	abstract = {The percentile bootstrap is the Swiss Army Knife of statistics: it is a non-parametric method based on data-driven simulations. It can be applied to many statistical problems, as a substitute to standard parametric approaches, or in situations where parametric methods do not exist. In this tutorial, we cover R code to implement the percentile bootstrap in a few situations: one-sample estimation and the comparison of two independent groups for measures of central tendency (means and trimmed means) and spread. For each example, we explain how to derive a bootstrap distribution, and how to get a confidence interval and a p value from that distribution. We also demonstrate how to run a simulation to assess the behaviour of the bootstrap. In some situations, the bootstrap performs poorly, such as when making inferences about the mean. But for other purposes, it is the only known method that works well over a broad range of situations, such as when comparing medians and there are tied (duplicated) values. More broadly, combining the percentile bootstrap with robust estimators, i.e. estimators that are not overly sensitive to outliers, the bootstrap can help users gain a deeper understanding of their data, relative to conventional methods.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, statistics educators have made important changes to introductory courses. Current guidelines emphasize developing statistical thinking in students and exposing them to the entire investigative process in the context of interesting research questions and real data. As a result, many concepts (confounding, multivariable models, study design, etc.) previously reserved only for higher-level courses now appear in introductory courses. Despite these changes, causality is rarely discussed in introductory courses, except for warning students “correlation does not imply causation” or covering the special case of randomized controlled experiments. In this paper, we argue causal inference concepts align well with statistics education guidelines for introductory courses by developing statistical and multivariable thinking, exposing students to many aspects of the investigative process, and fostering active learning. We discuss how to integrate causal inference concepts into introductory courses using causal diagrams and provide an illustrative example with youth smoking data. Through our website, we also provide a guided student activity and instructor resources.},

Method.Questionnaires which are published in peer-reviewed journals and listed in Pubmed or {PsycInfo} were included. The questionnaires were analysed and, using a content-analytical approach, the respective items were categorised and linked to the {ICF}. Results.Ten questionnaires were included. Ninety-four per cent (N=341) of the concepts could be linked to 37 different {ICF} categories. One hundred and seventy-one (50.1\%) concepts were linked to {ICF} categories of the component Body Function, 74 (21.7\%) to categories of the component Activity and Participation and none to categories of the component Environmental Factors. In total, 28.2\% of the linked concepts belonged to Personal factors, which are not yet classified in the {ICF}. The questionnaires exhibited considerable differences regarding content density (i.e. The average number of concepts per item) and content diversity (i.e. The number of {ICF} categories per concept). Conclusions.The {ICF} provides an useful external reference to identify and compare the concepts contained in mindfulness questionnaires. Also, mindfulness questionnaire concepts suggest potentially useful factors for classification within the {ICF}. © 2011 Informa {UK}, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Statistics students need to develop the capacity to make sense of the staggering amount of information collected in our increasingly data-centered world. Data science is an important part of modern statistics, but our introductory and second statistics courses often neglect this fact. This paper discusses ways to provide a practical foundation for students to learn to "compute with data" as defined by Nolan and Temple Lang (2010), as well as develop "data habits of mind" (Finzer, 2013). We describe how introductory and second courses can integrate two key precursors to data science: the use of reproducible analysis tools and access to large databases. By introducing students to commonplace tools for data management, visualization, and reproducible analysis in data science and applying these to real-world scenarios, we prepare them to think statistically in the era of big data.},

	abstract = {The bootstrap is a versatile technique that relies on data-driven simulations to make statistical inferences. When combined with robust estimators, the bootstrap can afford much more powerful and flexible inferences than is possible with standard approaches such as t-tests on means. In this R tutorial, we use detailed illustrations of bootstrap simulations to give readers an intuition of what the bootstrap does and how it can be applied to solve many practical problems, such as building confidence intervals for many aspects of the data. In particular, we illustrate how to build confidence intervals for measures of location, including measures of central tendency, in the one-sample case, for two independent and two dependent groups. We also demonstrate how to compare correlation coefficients using the bootstrap and to perform simulations to determine if the bootstrap is fit for purpose for a particular application. The tutorial also addresses two widespread misconceptions about the bootstrap: that it makes no assumptions about the data, and that it leads to robust inferences on its own. The tutorial focuses on detailed graphical descriptions, with data and code available online to reproduce the figures and analyses in the article (https://osf.io/8b4t5/).},

	abstract = {Over the past decade there has been a surge of empirical research investigating mental disorders as complex systems. In this paper, we investigate how to best make use of this growing body of empirical research and move the field toward its fundamental aims of explaining, predicting, and controlling psychopathology. We first review the contemporary philosophy of science literature on scientific theories and argue that fully achieving the aims of explanation, prediction, and control requires that we construct formal theories of mental disorders: theories expressed in the language of mathematics or a computational programming language. We then investigate three routes by which one can use empirical findings (i.e., data models) to construct formal theories: (a) using data models themselves as formal theories, (b) using data models to infer formal theories, and (c) comparing empirical data models to theory-implied data models in order to evaluate and refine an existing formal theory. We argue that the third approach is the most promising path forward and conclude by expanding on this approach, proposing a framework for theory construction that details how to best use empirical research to generate, develop, and test formal theories of mental disorders.},

The point of view expressed here is that observables are fundamental, and that the goal of statistical modeling should be to predict future observations, given the current data and other relevant information. Further, the prediction of future observables provides multiple advantages to practicing scientists, and to science in general. These include an interpretable numerical summary of a quantity of direct interest to current and future researchers, a calibrated prediction of what’s likely to happen in future experiments, a prediction that can be either “corroborated” or “refuted” through experimentation, and avoidance of inference about parameters; quantities that exists only as convenient indices of hypothetical distributions. Finally, the predictive probability of a future observable can be used as a standard for communicating the reliability of the current work, regardless of whether confirmatory experiments are conducted. Adoption of this paradigm would improve our rigor for scientific accuracy and reproducibility by shifting our focus from “finding differences” among hypothetical parameters to predicting observable events based on our current scientific understanding.},

	url = {https://osf.io/jqw35},
	abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned—that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that most inferential statistical tests in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. I demonstrate how foundational assumptions of the "random effects" model used pervasively in psychology impose far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints dramatically inflates false positive rates and routinely leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack any meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that the routine failure to consider the generalizability of one's conclusions from a statistical perspective lies at the root of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular {ML} methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of {ML} models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.},

However, these claims are typically supported by measurement-level models that fail to consider the effects of measurement (un)reliability. We use intuitive examples, Monte Carlo simulations, and a novel analytical framework to demonstrate that common strategies for establishing incremental construct validity using multiple regression analysis exhibit extremely high Type I error rates under parameter regimes common in many psychological domains. Counterintuitively, we find that error rates are highest—in some cases approaching 100\%—when sample sizes are large and reliability is moderate. Our findings suggest that a potentially large proportion of incremental validity claims made in the literature are spurious. We present a web application (http://jakewestfall.org/ivy/) that readers can use to explore the statistical properties of these and other incremental validity arguments. We conclude by reviewing {SEM}-based statistical approaches that appropriately control the Type I error rate when attempting to establish incremental validity.},

            is derived from postulating that information is finite and knowledge is information compression; 2)
            K
            is compatible and convertible to ordinary measures of effect size and algorithmic complexity; 3)
            K
            is physically interpretable as a measure of entropic efficiency. Moreover, the
            K
            function has useful properties that support its potential as a measure of knowledge.
          
          Examples given to illustrate the possible uses of K include: the knowledge value of proving Fermat's last theorem; the accuracy of measurements of the mass of the electron; the half life of predictions of solar eclipses; the usefulness of evolutionary models of reproductive skew; the significance of gender differences in personality; the sources of irreproducibility in psychology; the impact of scientific misconduct and questionable research practices; the knowledge value of astrology. Furthermore, measures derived from K may complement ordinary meta-analysis and may give rise to a universal classification of sciences and pseudosciences.
          Simple and memorable mathematical formulae that summarize the theory's key results may find practical uses in meta-research, philosophy and research policy.},

	abstract = {There is a third way of implementing probability models and practicing. This is to answer questions put in terms of observables. This eliminates frequentist hypothesis testing and Bayes factors and it also eliminates parameter estimation. The Third Way is the logical probability approach, which is to make statements \${\textbackslash}Pr(Y {\textbackslash}in y {\textbar} X,D,M)\$ about observables of interest \$Y\$ taking values \$y\$, given probative data \$X\$, past observations (when present) \$D\$ and some model (possibly deduced) \$M\$. Significance and the false idea that probability models show causality are no more, and in their place are importance and relevance. Models are built keeping on information that is relevant and important to a decision maker (and not a statistician). All models are stated in publicly verifiable fashion, as predictions. All models must undergo a verification process before any trust is put into them.},

Probability and statistical models are useless at discerning cause. Classical statistical procedures, in both their frequentist and Bayesian implementations are, falsely imply they can speak about cause. No hypothesis test, or Bayes factor, should ever be used again. Even assuming we know the cause or partial cause for some set of observations, reporting via relative risk exagerates the certainty we have in the future, often by a lot. This over-certainty is made much worse when parametetric and not predictive methods are used. Unfortunately, predictive methods are rarely used; and even when they are, cause must still be an assumption, meaning (again) certainty in our scientific pronouncements is too high.},

Three well-known problems with {ANOVA} are the sphericity assumption, the design effect (sampling hierarchy), and the requirement for complete designs and data sets. This tutorial explains and demonstrates multi-level modeling ({MLM}) as an alternative analysis tool for repeated measures data. {MLM} allows us to estimate variance and covariance components explicitly. {MLM} does not require sphericity, it takes the sampling hierarchy into account, and it is capable of analyzing incomplete data. A fictitious data set is analyzed with {MLM} and {ANOVA}, and analysis results are compared. Moreover, existing data from a repeated measures design are re-analyzed with {MLM}, to demonstrate its advantages. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that {MLM} yields higher power than {ANOVA}, in particular under realistic circumstances. Although technically complex, {MLM} is recommended as a useful tool for analyzing repeated measures data from speech research. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2018 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

As a non-judgmental stance, mindfulness should allow for greater perceptual objectivity. Previous research suggests that self-interest can motivate people to “see what they want to see” (Balcetis \& Dunning, 2006). We hypothesized that mindfulness would moderate this effect such that state and trait mindfulness would be associated with less motivated perception. We adapted the methods of Balcetis and Dunning (2006) in an online study (N=161). Results show that state and trait mindfulness predicted less motivated perception. These effects were stronger after excluding participants who noticed the ambiguity of the image as well as controlling for mood. These findings suggest that mindfulness is a stance of greater objectivity.},

These questions have been traditionally addressed by null hypothesis significance testing ({NHST}). {NHST} has deep problems that are solved by Bayesian data analysis. As psychologists transition to Bayesian data analysis, it is natural to ask how Bayesian analysis assesses null values. The article explains and evaluates two different Bayesian approaches. One method involves Bayesian model comparison (and uses Bayes factors). The second method involves Bayesian parameter estimation and assesses whether the null value falls among the most credible values. Which method to use depends on the specific question that the analyst wants to answer, but typically the estimation approach (not using Bayes factors) provides richer information than the model comparison approach.},

The survey instrument distinguishes five focal areas for quality improvement activities and four developmental stages. The study also reports data on the reliability and validity of the survey instrument. {CONCLUSION}: The instrument is reliable, easy to administer, and useful across health care fields as well as different kinds of organizations. Developing quality systems provide a common language across all parts of the health care sector. By assigning the activities to focal areas and developmental stages the instrument gives insight into the implementation of quality systems in health care. Comparable information on quality assurance activities increases the accountability of providers. Because of the efficient (not time consuming) approach, the instrument complements existing accreditation reviews.},

In addition, they generalized {CL} to the n-group case, the correlated samples case, and the discrete values case.In the current paper a different generalization of {CL}, called the A measure of stochastic superiority, is proposed, which may be directly applied for any discrete or continuous variable that is at least ordinally scaled. Exact methods for point and interval estimation as well as the significance tests of the A = .5 hypothesis are provided. New generalizations {ofCL} are provided for the multi-group and correlated samples cases.},

Unlike hypothesis testing, with conjoint measurement an increase in statistical power leads to a greater risk of refuting a theory. In this study, conjoint measurement was used to describe how systems-oriented therapists predict the occurrence of suicide. Although the systems approach emphasizes the interaction between an individual and a system, all 10 clinicians were described by an additive model.},

The objective of this article was to fill this gap by providing initial validation evidence of the German Inpatient Satisfaction Scale as an instrument for German-speaking countries. We performed an exploratory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling in a cross-sectional design. The instrument was administered to N = 116,325 patients in hospitals in German-speaking countries. The overall response rates ranged from 63\% to 98\%. We found that a four-factor solution fit the data well. The four factors represented satisfaction with doctors care, nursing care, service facilities, and secondary care facilities. Cronbachs alpha ranged from .72 to .90. The findings may be of practical interest for health care providers for measuring patient satisfaction.},

Given the importance of measurement in this field, this paper aims to further our understanding of the assessment of mindfulness by employing an approach referred to as “random forests” ({RF}). {RF} is an ensemble learning method that is based on decision trees. {RF} is well known in biological research, for example, but is practically unknown in psychometrics. In this study, {RF} was used to gauge the predictive validity of the items from two mindfulness instruments concerning their ability to estimate group allocation (i.e., mindfulness practitioners vs. nonpractitioners). To allow for a better generalization of the results, we examined the research questions in two samples (N=76 and N=202) of different quality. We investigated two instruments: the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory ({FMI}) and the Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale. Although results indicated that both instruments were capable of distinguishing practitioners from nonpractitioners, the predictive quality of most items on both scales was determined to be insufficient.},

We hypothesized that the "acceptance" facet of mindfulness, but not the "presence" facet, is negatively associated with the magnitude of emotional behavior in four tests, i.e., (1) rating of words, (2) rating of aversive and neutral pictures, and (3) evaluative conditioning ({EC}). Additionally, we hypothesized that (4) the acceptance facet is associated with increased reaction time ({RT}) in an emotional Stroop test, and that the presence facet is associated with decreased {RT} and lower error rate. The sample consisted of N=247 non-clinical adults and was tested in a cross-sectional study. The results provide partial evidence that the acceptance facet of mindfulness may be associated with less aversive reactions towards aversive stimuli. Future studies should substantiate these findings but also determine their clinical relevance.},

Until now, several scales have been published and to some degree also psychometrically validated. The number of scales reflects the widespread research interest.

The objective of the study was to identify factors that affect the survival of the patients with tuberculosis who started treatment for tuberculosis. Methods. This was a retrospective study in six randomly selected health centres in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The data were obtained from medical records of {TB} patients registered from September 2012 to August 2013 and treated under directly observed treatment surgery ({DOTS}) strategy. Kaplan Meier plots, logrank tests, and Wilcoxon tests were used to assess the survival pattern. Cox proportional hazards model for multivariable analysis was discussed. Results. Out of the total 826 registered {TB} patients, 105 (12.71\%) died during the study period and 712 (87.29\%) were censored. Based on Kaplan Meier survival curves, logrank test, and Wilcoxon test, it was found that the patients had statistically significant differences in survival experience with respect to age, body weight at initiation of treatment, {TB} patient category, and {HIV} status. Multivariable Cox hazards regression analysis revealed that the covariates age, {TB} patient category, {HIV}, and age by {HIV} interaction were significant risk factors associated with death status in {TB} patients. Conclusion. Deaths of individuals with diseases especially {HIV} coinfected and nonnew {TB} cases were high. Therefore, this needs to strengthen the follow-up of patients with {TB} treatment from the day of anti-{TB} treatment initiation to completion days.},

	abstract = {Background:
            Existing analyses of nonpharmaceutical interventions ({NPIs}) against {COVID}19 transmission have concentrated on the joint effectiveness of large-scale {NPIs}. With increasing data, we can move beyond estimating joint effects towards disentangling individual effects. In addition to effectiveness, policy decisions ought to account for the burden placed by different {NPIs} on the population.
            Methods:
            To our knowledge, this is the largest data-driven study of {NPI} effectiveness to date. We collected chronological data on 9 {NPIs} in 41 countries between January and April 2020, using extensive fact-checking to ensure high data quality. We infer {NPI} effectiveness with a novel semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model, modelling both confirmed cases and deaths to increase the signal from which {NPI} effects can be inferred. Finally, we study how much perceived burden different {NPIs} impose on the population with an online survey of preferences using the {MaxDiff} method.
            Results:
            Eight {NPIs} have a {\textgreater}95\% posterior probability of being effective: closing schools (mean reduction in R: 50\%; 95\% credible interval: 39\%-59\%), closing nonessential businesses (34\%; 16\%-49\%), closing high-risk businesses (26\%; 8\%-42\%), and limiting gatherings to 10 people or less (28\%; 8\%-45\%), to 100 people or less (17\%; -3\%-35\%), to 1000 people or less (16\%; -2\%-31\%), issuing stay-at-home orders (14\%; -2\%-29\%), and testing patients with respiratory symptoms (13\%; -1\%-26\%). As validation is crucial for {NPI} models, we performed 15 sensitivity analyses and evaluated predictions on unseen data, finding strong support for our results. We combine the effectiveness and preference results to estimate effectiveness-to-burden ratios.
            Conclusions:
            Our results suggest a surprisingly large role for schools in {COVID}-19 transmission, a contribution to the ongoing debate about the relevance of asymptomatic carriers in disease spreading. We identify additional interventions with good effectiveness-burden tradeoffs, namely symptomatic testing, closing high-risk businesses, and limiting gathering size. Closing most nonessential businesses and issuing stay-at-home orders impose a high burden while having a limited additional effect.},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

	abstract = {We propose a methodology to look at violence in particular, and other aspects of quantitative historiography in general, in a way compatible with statistical inference, which needs to accommodate the fat-tailedness of the data and the unreliability of the reports of conflicts. We investigate the theses of “long peace” and drop in violence and find that these are statistically invalid and resulting from flawed and naive methodologies, incompatible with fat tails and non-robust to minor changes in data formatting and methodologies. There is no statistical basis to claim that “times are different” owing to the long inter-arrival times between conflicts; there is no basis to discuss any “trend”, and no scientific basis for narratives about change in risk. We describe naive empiricism under fat tails. We also establish that violence has a “true mean” that is underestimated in the track record. This is a historiographical adaptation of the results in Cirillo and Taleb (2016).},

In the study, students familiar with traditional inference methods used physical and computer simulations to estimate p-values. To examine students’ conceptions before and after participation, students were prompted to write brief explanations of p-values, to apply these explanations in different contexts, and to self-evaluate their understanding. This article describes students’ varying conceptions of p-values and the ways in which students demonstrated improvement after engaging in simulation-based inference activities. Qualitative analysis of student responses suggests that students hold a range of conceptions of p-values even after a full semester of instruction; further, this study suggests that incorporating simulation-based inference into traditional courses has the potential to improve understanding of p-values and is a promising area for future research.},

A randomized experiment was conducted to administer the two curricula to students in an introductory statistics course. Students of the simulation-based curriculum were found to have improved learning outcomes on topics in statistical inference; however, a clear violation of between-student independence due to group administration of curriculum treatments casts considerable doubt on the statistical significance of these results. A simulation study is used to demonstrate the volatility of Type I error rates in educational studies where classroom level covariance structures exist by comparisons are made on the student level.},

However, little is known about whether these positive effects are preferentially distributed across types of students entering the course. We consider how two metrics of Stat 101 student preparation (precourse performance on concept inventory and math {ACT} score) may or may not be associated with end of course student performance on conceptual inventories. Students across all preparation levels tended to show improvement in Stat 101, but more improvement was observed across all student preparation levels in early versions of a {SBI} course. Furthermore, students' gains tended to be similar regardless of whether students entered the course with more preparation or less. Recent data on a sample of students using a current version of an {SBI} course showed similar results, though direct comparison with non-{SBI} students was not possible. Overall, our analysis provides additional evidence that {SBI} curricula are effective at improving students' conceptual understanding of statistical ideas postcourse regardless student preparation. Further work is needed to better understand nuances of student improvement based on other student demographics, prior coursework as well as instructor and institutional variables.},

Preliminary assessment data have been largely positive. This article describes the analysis of the first year of data from a multi-institution assessment effort by instructors using such an approach in a college-level introductory statistics course, some for the first time. We examine several pre-/post-measures of student attitudes and conceptual understanding of several topics in the introductory course. We highlight some patterns in the data, focusing on student level and instructor level variables and the application of hierarchical modeling to these data. One observation of interest is that the newer instructors see very similar gains to more experienced instructors, but we also look to how the data collection and analysis can be improved for future years, especially the need for more data on “nonusers.”},

A qualitative content analysis was used to investigate the science mobile app research for its mobile app design, underlying theoretical foundations, and students' measured outcomes. This review found that mobile apps for science learning offered a number of similar design features, including technology-based scaffolding, location-aware functionality, visual/audio representations, digital knowledge-construction tools, digital knowledge-sharing mechanisms, and differentiated roles. Many of the studies cited a specific theoretical foundation, predominantly situated learning theory, and applied this to the design of the mobile learning environment. The most common measured outcome was students' basic scientific knowledge or conceptual understanding. A number of recommendations came out of this review. Future studies need to make use of newer, available technologies; isolate the testing of specific app features; and develop additional strategies around using mobile apps for collaboration. Researchers need to make more explicit connections between the instructional principles and the design features of their mobile learning environment in order to better integrate theory with practice. In addition, this review noted that stronger alignment is needed between the underlying theories and measured outcomes, and more studies are needed to assess students' higher-level cognitive outcomes, cognitive load, and skill-based outcomes such as problem solving. Finally, more research is needed on how science mobile apps can be used with more varied science topics and diverse audiences.},

	abstract = {Children are in the midst of a vast, unplanned experiment, surrounded by digital technologies that were not available but 5 years ago. At the apex of this boom is the introduction of applications (“apps”) for tablets and smartphones. However, there is simply not the time, money, or resources available to evaluate each app as it enters the market. Thus, “educational” apps—the number of which, as of January 2015, stood at 80,000 in Apple’s App Store (Apple, 2015)—are largely unregulated and untested. This article offers a way to define the potential educational impact of current and future apps. We build upon decades of work on the Science of Learning, which has examined how children learn best. From this work, we abstract a set of principles for two ultimate goals. First, we aim to guide researchers, educators, and designers in evidence-based app development. Second, by creating an evidence-based guide, we hope to set a new standard for evaluating and selecting the most effective existing children’s apps. In short, we will show how the design and use of educational apps aligns with known processes of children’s learning and development and offer a framework that can be used by parents and designers alike. Apps designed to promote active, engaged, meaningful, and socially interactive learning—four “pillars” of learning—within the context of a supported learning goal are considered educational.},

Just because algorithms are based on code doesn't mean experiments are easily replicated. Far from it. Unpublished codes and a sensitivity to training conditions have made it difficult for {AI} researchers to reproduce many key results. That is leading to a new conscientiousness about research methods and publication protocols. Last week, at a meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in New Orleans, Louisiana, reproducibility was on the agenda, with some teams diagnosing the problem—and one laying out tools to mitigate it.
Unpublished code and sensitivity to training conditions make many claims hard to verify.

	abstract = {Albert Einstein (* 14. März 1879 in Ulm, Württemberg, Deutsches Reich; † 18. April 1955 in Princeton, New Jersey, Vereinigte Staaten) war ein deutscher Physiker mit Schweizer und {US}-amerikanischer Staatsbürgerschaft. Er gilt als einer der bedeutendsten theoretischen Physiker der Wissenschaftsgeschichte und weltweit als bekanntester Wissenschaftler der Neuzeit. Seine Forschungen zur Struktur von Materie, Raum und Zeit sowie zum Wesen der Gravitation veränderten maßgeblich das zuvor geltende newtonsche Weltbild.
Einsteins Hauptwerk, die Relativitätstheorie, machte ihn weltberühmt. Im Jahr 1905 erschien seine Arbeit mit dem Titel Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper, deren Inhalt heute als spezielle Relativitätstheorie bezeichnet wird. 1915 publizierte er die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie. Auch zur Quantenphysik leistete er wesentliche Beiträge. „Für seine Verdienste um die theoretische Physik, besonders für seine Entdeckung des Gesetzes des photoelektrischen Effekts“, erhielt er den Nobelpreis des Jahres 1921, der ihm 1922 überreicht wurde. Seine theoretischen Arbeiten spielten – im Gegensatz zur weit verbreiteten Meinung – beim Bau der Atombombe und der Entwicklung der Kernenergie nur eine indirekte Rolle.Albert Einstein gilt als Inbegriff des Forschers und Genies. Er nutzte seine außerordentliche Bekanntheit auch außerhalb der naturwissenschaftlichen Fachwelt bei seinem Einsatz für Völkerverständigung und Frieden.
Im Laufe seines Lebens war Einstein Staatsbürger mehrerer Länder: Durch Geburt besaß er die württembergische Staatsbürgerschaft. Von 1896 bis 1901 staatenlos, ab 1901 bis zu seinem Tode Staatsbürger der Schweiz, war er 1911/1912 in Österreich-Ungarn auch Bürger Österreichs. Von 1914 bis 1932 lebte Einstein in Berlin und war als Bürger Preußens erneut Staatsangehöriger im Deutschen Reich. Mit der Machtergreifung Hitlers gab er 1933 den deutschen Pass endgültig ab und wurde 1934 vom Deutschen Reich strafausgebürgert. Zusätzlich zu seinem Schweizer Bürgerrecht erwarb er 1940 noch die Staatsbürgerschaft der Vereinigten Staaten.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to contribute to greater understanding of the mathematics anxiety construct by: (a) identifying the independent dimensions underlying the item responses on the Math Anxiety Rating Scale ({MARS}); (b) developing factor scales to measure these dimensions; and (c) determining if specific personal and academic background variables can effectively serve as predictors of math anxiety as defined by the factor scales. The {MARS} was administered to 197 college students, and the responses were factor analyzed. Twenty-one factors were found; the first two components accounted for approximately 33\% and 7\% of the variance in {MARS} scores. The first item was labelled Math Test/Course Anxiety, while the second item concerned Numerical Task Anxiety. More anxiety was  stimulated by mathematics test items than by numerical task items. Analysis of variance procedures indicated that students who had taken Algebra {II} in high school experienced significantly less math anxiety than students who had not taken Algebra {II}, and those with A's and B's in Algebra or Geometry experienced significantly less math anxiety than did students with poorer grades. It is suggested that student performance in high school mathematics courses be monitored, and early intervention provided. ({MNS})},

Despite using a rich dataset and applying machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, the best predictions were not very accurate and were only slightly better than those from a simple benchmark model. Within each outcome, prediction error was strongly associated with the family being predicted and weakly associated with the technique used to generate the prediction. Overall, these results suggest practical limits to the predictability of life outcomes in some settings and illustrate the value of mass collaborations in the social sciences.},

This contribution aims to remind readers what power analysis is, emphasize why it matters, and articulate when and how it should be used. The focus is on applications of power analysis for experimental designs often encountered in psychology, starting from simple two-group independent and paired groups and moving to one-way analysis of variance, factorial designs, contrast analysis, trend analysis, regression analysis, analysis of covariance, and mediation analysis. Special attention is given to the application of power analysis to moderation designs, considering both dichotomous and continuous predictors and moderators. Illustrative practical examples based on G*Power and R packages are provided throughout the article. Annotated code for the examples with R and dedicated computational tools are made freely available at a dedicated web page (https://github.com/mcfanda/{primerPowerIRSP}). Applications of power analysis for more complex designs are briefly mentioned, and some important general issues related to power analysis are discussed.},

This study aimed to investigate the psychological symptoms of ordinary Chinese citizens during the Level I Emergency Response throughout China. From January 31 to February 2 2020, an online questionnaire, Symptom Checklist 90 ({SCL}-90) was designed, and differences in {GSI} T-scores among subgroups were examined by {ANOVA}. Based on a cut-off point of the {GSI} T-scores of 63, the overall sample was divided into high and low-risk groups. of the 1,060 participants investigated in China, more than 70\% of them have moderate and higher level of psychological symptoms specifically elevated scores for obsessive compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism. There were no significant differences between males and females. Those who were of over 50 years old, had an undergraduate education and below, were divorced or widowed, and agricultural workers had significantly more symptoms. However, significantly more minors and medical staff were in the high-risk group. These results show that {COVID}-19 has a significant adverse socio-psychological influence on ordinary citizens. Therefore, governments should equip psychological health departments and pay attention to the people who are in high-risk groups, providing psychological interventions and assistance.},

Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus. Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the {COVID}-19 and mass isolation were not available. To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21–40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).},

The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale ({SAS}) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale ({SDS}) were used.Results: Females’ anxiety risk was 3.01 times compared to males (95\% {CI} 1.39–6.52). Compared with people below 40 years old, the anxiety risk of people above 40 years old was 0.40 times (95\% {CI} 0.16–0.99). {SDS} results indicated that the difference between education level and occupation was statistically significant (p = 0.024, 0.005). Compared to people with a master’s degree or above, those with a bachelor’s degree group had a depression risk of 0.39 times (95\% {CI} 0.17–0.87). Compared with professionals, industrial service workers and other staff had a depression risk of 0.31 times (95\% {CI} 0.15–0.65) and 0.38 times (95\% {CI} 0.15–0.93).Conclusions: 600 questionnaire participants were psychologically stable. Non-anxiety and non-depression rates were 93.67\% and 82.83\%, respectively. There were anxiety in 6.33\% and depression in 17.17\%. Therefore, we should pay attention to the psychological states of the public.},

Across three studies (total n = 984), we developed a battery of social psychology-relevant questionnaires to measure {COVID}-19 phenomena: (1) Perceived Coronavirus Threat Questionnaire, (2) Governmental Response to Coronavirus Questionnaire, (3) Coronavirus Impacts Questionnaire, and (4) Coronavirus Experience Questionnaire. Exploratory (Study 1) and Confirmatory (Studies 2 and 3) Factor Analyses revealed excellent factor structures for the one-factor Perceived Coronavirus Threat, the six-factor Governmental Response Questionnaires, and the three-factor Coronavirus Impacts Questionnaire.  The three-factor Coronavirus Experience Questionnaire yielded poorer psychometric properties overall.  Given that brevity is often desired for online studies, we further recommend psychometrically sound short versions of each questionnaire.  Taken in total, this work offers social psychology researchers a battery of questionnaires to measure Coronavirus-related phenomena for the duration of the pandemic in U.S. participants.},

Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the {COVID}-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the {PubMed} database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28\%) and self-reported stress (8\%) are common psychological reactions to the {COVID}-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the {COVID}-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations.},

The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of {COVID}-19 on people\&rsquo;s mental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide timely services to affected populations. We sample and analyze the Weibo posts from 17,865 active Weibo users using the approach of Online Ecological Recognition ({OER}) based on several machine-learning predictive models. We calculated word frequency, scores of emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford happiness) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk judgment and life satisfaction) from the collected data. The sentiment analysis and the paired sample t-test were performed to examine the differences in the same group before and after the declaration of {COVID}-19 on 20 January, 2020. The results showed that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression and indignation) and sensitivity to social risks increased, while the scores of positive emotions (e.g., Oxford happiness) and life satisfaction decreased. People were concerned more about their health and family, while less about leisure and friends. The results contribute to the knowledge gaps of short-term individual changes in psychological conditions after the outbreak. It may provide references for policy makers to plan and fight against {COVID}-19 effectively by improving stability of popular feelings and urgently prepare clinical practitioners to deliver corresponding therapy foundations for the risk groups and affected people.},

Thus, we investigated the relationships between total cell phone use (N=496) and texting (N=490) on Satisfaction with Life ({SWL}) in a large sample of college students. It was hypothesized that the relationship would be mediated by Academic Performance ({GPA}) and anxiety. Two separate path models indicated that the cell phone use and texting models had good overall fit. Cell phone use/texting was negatively related to {GPA} and positively related to anxiety; in turn, {GPA} was positively related to {SWL} while anxiety was negatively related to {SWL}.

The results showed that the {PMPUQ} has an acceptable fit and assesses four different dimensions of problematic mobile phone use (prohibited use, dangerous use, dependence, financial problems). While each facet of impulsivity played a specific role in mobile phones use, urgency appeared to be the strongest predictor of problematic use. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Nevertheless, some people still use their mobile phones despite recognized safety concerns, legislation, and informal bans. Drawing potential predictors from the addiction literature, this study sought to predict usage and, specifically, problematic mobile phone use from extraversion, self-esteem, neuroticism, gender, and age. To measure problem use, the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale was devised and validated as a reliable self-report instrument, against the Addiction Potential Scale and overall mobile phone usage levels. Problem use was a function of age, extraversion, and low self-esteem, but not neuroticism. As extraverts are more likely to take risks, and young drivers feature prominently in automobile accidents, this study supports community concerns about mobile phone use, and identifies groups that should be targeted in any intervention campaigns.},

	abstract = {The aims of this study were: (1) to examine the prevalence of symptoms of problematic cellular phone use ({CPU}); (2) to examine the associations between the symptoms of problematic {CPU}, functional impairment caused by {CPU} and the characteristics of {CPU}; (3) to establish the optimal cut-off point of the number of symptoms for functional impairment caused by {CPU}; and (4) to examine the association between problematic {CPU} and depression in adolescents. A total of 10,191 adolescent students in Southern Taiwan were recruited into this study. Participants' self-reported symptoms of problematic {CPU} and functional impairments caused by {CPU} were collected. The associations of symptoms of problematic {CPU} with functional impairments and with the characteristics of {CPU} were examined. The cut-off point of the number of symptoms for functional impairment was also determined. The association between problematic {CPU} and depression was examined by logistic regression analysis. The results indicated that the symptoms of problematic {CPU} were prevalent in adolescents. The adolescents who had any one of the symptoms of problematic {CPU} were more likely to report at least one dimension of functional impairment caused by {CPU}, called more on cellular phones, sent more text messages, or spent more time and higher fees on {CPU}. Having four or more symptoms of problematic {CPU} had the highest potential to differentiate between the adolescents with and without functional impairment caused by {CPU}. Adolescents who had significant depression were more likely to have four or more symptoms of problematic {CPU}. The results of this study may provide a basis for detecting symptoms of problematic {CPU} in adolescents.},

            Linear regression analyses commonly involve two consecutive stages of statistical inquiry. In the first stage, a single ‘best’ model is defined by a specific selection of relevant predictors; in the second stage, the regression coefficients of the winning model are used for prediction and for inference concerning the importance of the predictors. However, such second-stage inference ignores the model uncertainty from the first stage, resulting in overconfident parameter estimates that generalize poorly. These drawbacks can be overcome by model averaging, a technique that retains all models for inference, weighting each model’s contribution by its posterior probability. Although conceptually straightforward, model averaging is rarely used in applied research, possibly due to the lack of easily accessible software. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we provide a tutorial on linear regression using Bayesian model averaging in , based on the {BAS} package in . Firstly, we provide theoretical background on linear regression, Bayesian inference, and Bayesian model averaging. Secondly, we demonstrate the method on an example data set from the World Happiness Report. Lastly, we discuss limitations of model averaging and directions for dealing with violations of model assumptions.},

	abstract = {There is ample evidence that masking and social distancing are effective in reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) transmission. However, due to the complexity of airborne disease transmission, it is difficult to quantify their effectiveness, especially in the case of one-to-one exposure. Here, we introduce the concept of an upper bound for one-to-one exposure to infectious human respiratory particles and apply it to {SARS}-{CoV}-2. To calculate exposure and infection risk, we use a comprehensive database on respiratory particle size distribution; exhalation flow physics; leakage from face masks of various types and fits measured on human subjects; consideration of ambient particle shrinkage due to evaporation; and rehydration, inhalability, and deposition in the susceptible airways. We find, for a typical {SARS}-{CoV}-2 viral load and infectious dose, that social distancing alone, even at 3.0 m between two speaking individuals, leads to an upper bound of 90\% for risk of infection after a few minutes. If only the susceptible wears a face mask with infectious speaking at a distance of 1.5 m, the upper bound drops very significantly; that is, with a surgical mask, the upper bound reaches 90\% after 30 min, and, with an {FFP}2 mask, it remains at about 20\% even after 1 h. When both wear a surgical mask, while the infectious is speaking, the very conservative upper bound remains below 30\% after 1 h, but, when both wear a well-fitting {FFP}2 mask, it is 0.4\%. We conclude that wearing appropriate masks in the community provides excellent protection for others and oneself, and makes social distancing less important.},

Design Prospective cohort study following patients from the time of acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (glandular fever), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), or Ross River virus (epidemic polyarthritis).
Setting The region surrounding the township of Dubbo in rural Australia, encompassing a 200 km geographical radius and 104 400 residents.
Participants 253 patients enrolled and followed at regular intervals over 12 months by self report, structured interview, and clinical assessment.
Outcome measures Detailed medical, psychiatric, and laboratory evaluations at six months to apply diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Premorbid and intercurrent illness characteristics recorded to define risk factors for chronic fatigue syndrome. Self reported illness phenotypes compared between infective groups.
Results Prolonged illness characterised by disabling fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive difficulties, and mood disturbance was evident in 29 (12\%) of 253 participants at six months, of whom 28 (11\%) met the diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. This post-infective fatigue syndrome phenotype was stereotyped and occurred at a similar incidence after each infection. The syndrome was predicted largely by the severity of the acute illness rather than by demographic, psychological, or microbiological factors.
Conclusions A relatively uniform post-infective fatigue syndrome persists in a significant minority of patients for six months or more after clinical infection with several different viral and non-viral micro-organisms. Post-infective fatigue syndrome is a valid illness model for investigating one pathophysiological pathway to chronic fatigue syndrome.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the statistical distributions of the position and the size of the evaporating droplets after a cough are evaluated, thus characterizing the inherent stochasticity of respiratory releases due to turbulence. For that, ten independent realizations of a cough with realistic initial conditions and in a room at 20 °C and 40\% relative humidity were performed with large eddy simulations and Lagrangian tracking of the liquid phase. It was found that although turbulence decreases far from the emitter, it results in large variations in the spatial distribution of the droplets. The total suspended liquid mass after 60 s from the cough is in good agreement with that estimated by a one-dimensional model accounting for settling and evaporation under quiescent conditions, while deposition times of droplets in the 10–100 μm range are found to vary significantly, reflected in the mass of liquid, and hence the virus content, potentially inhaled by a receptor. The high variability between events is due to the local fluctuations of temperature, humidity, and velocity on droplet evaporation and motion. The droplet distribution suggests that, in the absence of face coverings, an unprotected cough is not safe at 2 m away from the emitter even outdoors. The results indicate that mitigation measures, such as ventilation to address long-range transmission, can be based on the total suspended liquid content evaluated from reduced-order models. However, the large variability of viral content in the near field produces wide variations in estimates of risk; therefore, a stochastic approach is needed for evaluating short-range transmission risk.},

	abstract = {Introduction Excess mortality is a suitable indicator of health consequences of {COVID}-19 because death from any cause is clearly defined contrary to death from Covid-19. We compared the overall mortality in 2020 with the overall mortality in 2016 to 2019 in Germany, Sweden and Spain. Contrary to other studies, we also took the demographic development between 2016 and 2020 and increasing life expectancy into account. Methods Using death and population figures from the {EUROSTAT} database, we estimated weekly and cumulative Standardized Mortality Ratios ({SMR}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) for the year 2020. We applied two approaches to calculate weekly numbers of death expected in 2020: first, we used mean weekly mortality rates from 2016 to 2019 as expected mortality rates for 2020, and, second, to consider increasing life expectancy, we calculated expected mortality rates for 2020 by extrapolation from mortality rates from 2016 to 2019. Results In the first approach, the cumulative {SMRs} show that in Germany and Sweden there was no or little excess mortality in 2020 ({SMR} = 0.976 (95\% {CI}: 0.974–0.978), and 1.030 (1.023–1.036), respectively), while in Spain the excess mortality was 14.8\% (1.148 (1.144–1.151)). In the second approach, the corresponding {SMRs} for Germany and Sweden increased to 1.009 (1.007–1.011) and 1.083 (1.076–1.090), respectively, whereas results for Spain were virtually unchanged. Conclusion In 2020, there was barely any excess mortality in Germany for both approaches. In Sweden, excess mortality was 3\% without, and 8\% with consideration of increasing life expectancy.},

	abstract = {Comparing the impact of the {COVID}-19 pandemic between countries or across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the expected mortality, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the {COVID}-19 death toll. However, there has been no global, frequently updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 103 countries and territories, openly available as the regularly updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. We found that in several worst-affected countries (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) the excess mortality was above 50\% of the expected annual mortality (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) or above 400 excess deaths per 100,000 population (Peru, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Serbia). At the same time, in several other countries (e.g. Australia and New Zealand) mortality during the pandemic was below the usual level, presumably due to social distancing measures decreasing the non-{COVID} infectious mortality. Furthermore, we found that while many countries have been reporting the {COVID}-19 deaths very accurately, some countries have been substantially underreporting their {COVID}-19 deaths (e.g. Nicaragua, Russia, Uzbekistan), by up to two orders of magnitude (Tajikistan). Our results highlight the importance of open and rapid all-cause mortality reporting for pandemic monitoring.},

We start by summarizing why one should consider the Bayesian approach to the most common forms of regression. Next we introduce the R package rstanarm for Bayesian applied regression modeling. An overview of rstanarm fundamentals accompanies step-by-step guidance for fitting a single-level regression model with the stan\_glm function, and fitting hierarchical regression models with the stan\_lmer function, illustrated with data from an experience sampling study on changes in affective states. Exploration of the results is facilitated by the intuitive and user-friendly shinystan package. Data and scripts are available on the Open Science Framework page of the project. For readers unfamiliar with R, this tutorial is self-contained to enable all researchers who apply regression techniques to try these methods with their own data. Regression modeling with the functions in the rstanarm package will be a straightforward transition for researchers familiar with their frequentist counterparts, lm (or glm) and lmer.

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Although null hypothesis significance testing ({NHST}) is the agreed gold standard in medical decision making and the most widespread inferential framework used in medical research, it has several drawbacks. Bayesian methods can complement or even replace frequentist {NHST}, but these methods have been underutilised mainly due to a lack of easy-to-use software. {JASP} is an open-source software for common operating systems, which has recently been developed to make Bayesian inference more accessible to researchers, including the most common tests, an intuitive graphical user interface and publication-ready output plots. This article provides a non-technical introduction to Bayesian hypothesis testing in {JASP} by comparing traditional tests and statistical methods with their Bayesian counterparts.
            
            
              Results
              
                The comparison shows the strengths and limitations of {JASP} for frequentist {NHST} and Bayesian inference. Specifically, Bayesian hypothesis testing via Bayes factors can complement and even replace {NHST} in most situations in {JASP}. While
                p
                -values can only reject the null hypothesis, the Bayes factor can state evidence for both the null and the alternative hypothesis, making confirmation of hypotheses possible. Also, effect sizes can be precisely estimated in the Bayesian paradigm via {JASP}.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                Bayesian inference has not been widely used by now due to the dearth of accessible software. Medical decision making can be complemented by Bayesian hypothesis testing in {JASP}, providing richer information than single
                p
                -values and thus strengthening the credibility of an analysis. Through an easy point-and-click interface researchers used to other graphical statistical packages like {SPSS} can seemlessly transition to {JASP} and benefit from the listed advantages with only few limitations.},

Further, he mentions the so called {ROPE}-only decision rule within his supplementary material, which is based on {ROPE}, but uses the full posterior information instead of the {HDI}. Of course, if it is about formalizing and guiding decisions then statistical decision theory is the framework to rely on, and this technical report elaborates the decision theoretic foundations of both decision rules. It appears that the foundation of the {HDI}+{ROPE} decision rule is rather artificial compared to the foundation of the {ROPE}-only decision rule, such that latter might be characterized as being closer to the underlying practical purpose than former. Still, the {ROPE}-only decision rule employs a truly arbitrary, and thus debatable, choice of loss values.},

	abstract = {Psychological theories often invoke interactions but remain vague regarding the details. As a consequence, researchers may not know how to properly test them and may potentially run analyses that reliably return the wrong answer to their research question. We discuss three major issues regarding the prediction and interpretation of interactions. First, interactions can be removable in the sense that they appear or disappear depending on scaling decisions, with consequences for a variety of situations (e.g., binary or categorical outcomes, bounded scales with floor and ceiling effects). Second, interactions may be conceptualized as changes in slope or changes in correlations, and because these two phenomena do not necessarily coincide, researchers might draw wrong conclusions. Third, interactions may or may not be causally identified, and this determines which interpretations are valid. Researchers who remain unaware of these distinctions might accidentally analyze their data in a manner that returns the technically correct answer to the wrong question. We illustrate all issues with examples from psychology and issue recommendations for how to best address them in a productive manner.},

In this brief article I discuss one counterexample: Shepard’s law of generalization and the various Bayesian extensions that it inspired over the past 3 decades. Using Shepard’s law as a running example, I argue that psychological theory building is not a statistical problem, mathematical formalism is beneficial to theory, measurement and theory have a complex relationship, rewriting old theory can yield new insights, and theory growth can drive empirical work. Although I generally suggest that the tools of mathematical psychology are valuable to psychological theorists, I also comment on some limitations to this approach.},

	abstract = {Statistical science (as opposed to mathematical statistics) involves far more than probability theory, for it requires realistic causal models of data generators - even for purely descriptive goals. Statistical decision theory requires more causality: Rational decisions are actions taken to minimize costs while maximizing benefits, and thus require explication of causes of loss and gain. Competent statistical practice thus integrates logic, context, and probability into scientific inference and decision using narratives filled with causality. This reality was seen and accounted for intuitively by the founders of modern statistics, but was not well recognized in the ensuing statistical theory (which focused instead on the causally inert properties of probability measures). Nonetheless, both statistical foundations and basic statistics can and should be taught using formal causal models. The causal view of statistical science fits within a broader information-processing framework which illuminates and unifies frequentist, Bayesian, and related probability-based foundations of statistics. Causality theory can thus be seen as a key component connecting computation to contextual information, not extra-statistical but instead essential for sound statistical training and applications.},

Standard study designs can lead to the use of analysis methods for which power formulae do not exist. This may be because complex modelling techniques with optimal statistical properties are used but power formulae have not yet been derived or because analysis models are employed that divert from the population model due to lack of availability of more appropriate analysis tools. Our presentation concentrates on the conceptual steps involved in carrying out power or precision calculations by simulation. We demonstrate these steps in three examples concerned with (i) drop out in longitudinal studies, (ii) measurement error in observational studies and (iii) causal effect estimation in randomised controlled trials with non-compliance. We conclude that the Monte Carlo simulation approach is an important general tool in the methodological arsenal for assessing power and precision.},

	url = {https://www.rki.de/SharedDocs/FAQ/COVID-Impfen/FAQ_Transmission.html},
	abstract = {Daten aus Zulassungsstudien wie auch aus Untersuchungen im Rahmen der breiten Anwendung (sog. Beobachtungsstudien) belegen, dass die in Deutschland zur Anwendung kommenden {COVID}-19-Impfstoffe {SARS}-{CoV}-2-Infektionen (symptomatisch und asymptomatisch) in einem erheblichen Maße verhindern. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass eine Person trotz vollständiger Impfung {PCR}-positiv wird, ist bereits niedrig, aber nicht Null.
In welchem Maß die Impfung darüber hinaus die Übertragung des Virus weiter reduziert, kann derzeit nicht genau quantifiziert werden. Auf Basis der bisher vorliegenden Daten ist davon auszugehen, dass die Viruslast bei Personen, die trotz Impfung mit {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infiziert werden, stark reduziert und die Virusausscheidung verkürzt ist.
In der Summe ist daher das Risiko einer Virusübertragung stark vermindert. Es muss jedoch davon ausgegangen werden, dass einige Menschen nach Kontakt mit {SARS}-{CoV}-2 trotz Impfung (asymptomatisch) {PCR}-positiv werden und dabei auch infektiöse Viren ausscheiden. Dieses Risiko muss durch das Einhalten der Infektionsschutzmaßnahmen zusätzlich reduziert werden. Daher empfiehlt die Ständige Impfkommission ({STIKO}) auch nach Impfung die allgemein empfohlenen Schutzmaßnahmen (Alltagsmasken, Hygieneregeln, Abstandhalten, Lüften) weiterhin einzuhalten. Das Ausmaß, in dem die Virusübertragung reduziert wird, variiert je nach Virusvariante. Bei allen derzeit dominierenden Virusvarianten ist das Risiko einer Virusübertragung stark vermindert, allerdings ist bei der Delta-Variante von einer reduzierten Wirksamkeit gegen {SARS}-{CoV}-2-Infektionen auszugehen (siehe dazu die {FAQ} "Welchen Einfluss haben die neuen Varianten von {SARS}-{CoV}-2 auf die Wirksamkeit der {COVID}-19-Impfstoffe?").

Aus Public-Health-Sicht erscheint durch die Impfung das Risiko einer Virusübertragung in dem Maß reduziert, dass Geimpfte bei der Epidemiologie der Erkrankung keine wesentliche Rolle mehr spielen.

Diese Einschätzungen beruhen auf folgender Evidenz (für eine ausführliche Darstellung siehe auch: Wie gut schützt die {COVID}-19-Impfung vor {SARS}-{CoV}-2-Infektionen und -Transmission? Systematischer Review und Evidenzsynthese):

Die Impfung hat eine hohe Schutzwirkung (mindestens 80\%) gegen schweres {COVID}-19, unabhängig vom verwendeten Impfstoff (Comirnaty von {BioNTech}/Pfizer, Spikevax von Moderna, Vaxzevria von {AstraZeneca}).
Die derzeitige Datenlage zeigt darüber hinaus, dass die Impfung mit dem {AstraZeneca}-Impfstoff wie auch mit {mRNA}-Impfstoffen zu einer deutlichen Reduktion der {SARS}-{CoV}-2-Infektionen (symptomatisch + asymptomatisch) führt (Schutzwirkung etwa 80-90\% nach der 2. Impfstoffdosis).
Weitere Daten belegen, dass selbst bei Menschen, die trotz Impfung {PCR}-positiv werden, die Viruslast signifikant reduziert wird (Ct Shift) und weniger lange anhält (verkürztes Shedding).

	title = {Single Dose Administration, And The Influence Of The Timing Of The Booster Dose On Immunogenicity and Efficacy Of {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 ({AZD}1222) Vaccine},
	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3777268},
	abstract = {Background: The {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 ({AZD}1222) vaccine has been approved for emergency use by the {UK} regulatory authority, {MHRA}, with a regimen of two standard doses given with an interval of between 4 and 12 weeks. The planned rollout in the {UK} will involve vaccinating people in high risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later.Here we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered.Methods: We present data from phase {III} efficacy trials of {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 in the United Kingdom and Brazil, and phase I/{II} clinical trials in the {UK} and South Africa, against symptomatic disease caused by {SARS}-{CoV}-2. The data cut-off date for these analyses was 7th December 2020. The accumulated cases of {COVID}-19 disease at this cut-off date exceeds the number required for a pre-specified final analysis, which is also presented. As previously described, individuals over 18 years of age were randomised 1:1 to receive two standard doses ({SD}) of {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 (5x1010 viral particles) or a control vaccine/saline placebo. In the {UK} trial efficacy cohort a subset of participants received a lower dose ({LD}, 2.2x1010 viral particles) of the {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 for the first dose. All cases with a nucleic acid amplification test ({NAAT}) were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis, by a blinded independent endpoint review committee. Studies are registered at {ISRCTN}89951424 and {ClinicalTrials}.gov; {NCT}04324606, {NCT}04400838, and {NCT}04444674.Findings: 17,177 baseline seronegative trial participants were eligible for inclusion in the efficacy analysis, 8948 in the {UK}, 6753 in Brazil and 1476 in South Africa, with 619 documented {NAAT} +ve infections of which 332 met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection {\textgreater}14 days post dose 2.The primary analysis of overall vaccine efficacy {\textgreater}14 days after the second dose including {LD}/{SD} and {SD}/{SD} groups, based on the prespecified criteria was 66.7\% (57.4\%,  74.0\%). There were no hospitalisations in the {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 group after the initial 21 day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group.Vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 post vaccination was 76\% (59\%, 86\%), and modelled analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3 month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 day ({GMR} 0.66, 95\% {CI} 0.59, 0.74).In the {SD}/{SD} group, after the second dose, efficacy was higher with a longer prime-boost interval: {VE} 82.4\% 95\%{CI} 62.7\%, 91.7\% at 12+ weeks, compared with {VE} 54.9\%, 95\%{CI} 32.7\%, 69.7\% at {\textless}6 weeks. These observations are supported by immunogenicity data which showed binding antibody responses more than 2-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with and interval of less than 6 weeks {GMR} 2.19 (2.12, 2.26) in those who were 18-55 years of age.Interpretation: {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 vaccination programmes aimed at vaccinating a large proportion of the population with a single dose, with a second dose given after a 3 month period is an effective strategy for reducing disease, and may be the optimal for rollout of a pandemic vaccine when supplies are limited in the short term.Trial Registration: Studies are registered at {ISRCTN}89951424 and {ClinicalTrials}.gov; {NCT}04324606, {NCT}04400838, and {NCT}04444674.Funding: {UKRI}, {NIHR}, {CEPI}, the Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation, the Lemann Foundation, Rede D’{OR}, the Brava and Telles Foundation, {NIHR} Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midland's {NIHR} Clinical Research Network, and Astra Zeneca.Conflict of Interest: Oxford University has entered into a partnership with Astra Zeneca for further development of {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19. {SCG} is co-founder of Vaccitech (collaborators in the early development of this vaccine candidate) and named as an inventor on a patent covering use of {ChAdOx}1-vectored vaccines and a patent application covering this {SARS}-{CoV}-2 vaccine. {TL} is named as aninventor on a patent application covering this {SARS}-{CoV}-2 vaccine and was a consultant to Vaccitech for an unrelated project. {PMF} is a consultant to Vaccitech. {AJP} is Chair of {UK} Dept.Health and Social Care’s ({DHSC}) Joint Committee on Vaccination \& Immunisation ({JCVI}), but does not participate in discussions on {COVID}-19 vaccines, and is a member of the {WHO}’{sSAGE}. {AJP} and {SNF} are {NIHR} Senior Investigator.

Swabs were tested by nucleic acid amplification test ({NAAT}) for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and positive samples were sequenced through the {COVID}-19 Genomics {UK} consortium. Neutralising antibody responses were measured using a live-virus microneutralisation assay against the B.1.1.7 lineage and a canonical non-B.1.1.7 lineage (Victoria). The efficacy analysis included symptomatic {COVID}-19 in seronegative participants with a {NAAT} positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to vaccine received.

          Beyond their substantial protection of individual vaccinees, it is hoped that the {COVID}-19 vaccines would reduce viral load in breakthrough infections thereby further suppress onward transmission. Here, analyzing positive {SARS}-{CoV}-2 test results following inoculation with the {BNT}162b2 {mRNA} vaccine, we find that the viral load is reduced 4-fold for infections occurring 12-28 days after the first dose of vaccine. These reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread.},

	abstract = {Introduction to Modern Statistics is a re-imagining of a previous title, Introduction to Statistics with Randomization and Simulation. The new book puts a heavy emphasis on exploratory data analysis (specifically exploring multivariate relationships using visualization, summarization, and descriptive models) and provides a thorough discussion of simulation-based inference using randomization and bootstrapping, followed by a presentation of the related Central Limit Theorem based approaches. Other highlights include:

Web native book. The online book is available in {HTML}, which offers easy navigation and searchability in the browser. The book is built with the bookdown package and the source code to reproduce the book can be found on {GitHub}. Along with the bookdown site, this book is also available as a {PDF} and in paperback.

Tutorials. While the main text of the book is agnostic to statistical software and computing language, each part features 4-8 interactive R tutorials (for a total of 32 tutorials) that walk you through the implementation of the part content in R with the tidyverse for data wrangling and visualisation and the tidyverse-friendly infer package for inference. The self-paced and interactive R tutorials were developed using the learnr R package, and only an internet browser is needed to complete them.

Labs. Each part also features 1-2 R based labs. The labs consist of data analysis case studies and they also make heavy use of the tidyverse and infer packages.

Datasets. Datasets used in the book are marked with a link to where you can find the raw data. The majority of these point to the openintro package. You can install the openintro package from {CRAN} or get the development version on {GitHub}.},

But for diseases transmitted via casual contact, contagiousness arises from a plethora of social and physiological factors, so epidemiologists have tended to rely on population averages to assess a disease's potential to spread. A new analysis of outbreak data shows that individual differences in infectiousness exert powerful influences on the epidemiology of ten deadly diseases. {SARS} and measles (and perhaps avian influenza) show strong tendencies towards ‘superspreading events’ that can ignite explosive epidemics — but this same volatility makes outbreaks more likely to fizzle out. Smallpox and pneumonic plague, two potential bioterrorism agents, show steadier growth but still differ markedly from the traditional average-based view. These findings are relevant to how emerging diseases are detected and controlled.},

In recent years, the econophysical literature has proposed a large amount of papers and models justifying the presence of power laws in economic data. Most of the times, this Paretianity is inferred from the observation of some plots, such as the Zipf plot and the mean excess plot. If the Zipf plot looks almost linear, then everything is ok and the parameters of the Pareto distribution are estimated. Often with {OLS}. Unfortunately, as we show in this paper, these heuristic graphical tools are not reliable. To be more exact, we show that only a combination of plots can give some degree of confidence about the real presence of Paretianity in the data. We start by reviewing some of the most important plots, discussing their points of strength and weakness, and then we propose some additional tools that can be used to refine the analysis.},

Here, we combine empirical observations of {SARS}-{CoV} and {SARS}-{CoV}-2 transmission and extreme value statistics to show that the distribution of secondary cases is consistent with being fat-tailed, implying that large superspreading events are extremal, yet probable, occurrences. We integrate these results with interaction-based network models of disease transmission and show that superspreading, when it is fat-tailed, leads to pronounced transmission by increasing dispersion. Our findings indicate that large superspreading events should be the targets of interventions that minimize tail exposure.},

	abstract = {Background: {COVID}-19 vaccines have had expedited reviews without sufficient safety data. We wanted to compare risks and benefits. Method: We calculated the number needed to vaccinate ({NNTV}) from a large Israeli field study to prevent one death. We accessed the Adverse Drug Reactions ({ADR}) database of the European Medicines Agency and of the Dutch National Register (lareb.nl) to extract the number of cases reporting severe side effects and the number of cases with fatal side effects. Result: The {NNTV} is between 200–700 to prevent one case of {COVID}-19 for the {mRNA} vaccine marketed by Pfizer, while the {NNTV} to prevent one death is between 9000 and 50,000 (95\% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate. The number of cases experiencing adverse reactions has been reported to be 700 per 100,000 vaccinations. Currently, we see 16 serious side effects per 100,000 vaccinations, and the number of fatal side effects is at 4.11/100,000 vaccinations. For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination. Conclusions: This lack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy.},

Study 2 revealed a contrast effect when the activated information was not representative for the absolute judgment and the targets of the 2 judgment tasks were sufficiently different. Study 3 demonstrated that generating absolute judgments requires more time when comparative judgments include an implausible anchor and can therefore be made without relevant target information that would otherwise be accessible.},

Studies have used datasets sampled from patients admitted to hospital, people tested for active infection, or people who volunteered to participate. Here, we highlight the challenge of interpreting observational evidence from such non-representative samples. Collider bias can induce associations between two or more variables which affect the likelihood of an individual being sampled, distorting associations between these variables in the sample. Analysing {UK} Biobank data, compared to the wider cohort the participants tested for {COVID}-19 were highly selected for a range of genetic, behavioural, cardiovascular, demographic, and anthropometric traits. We discuss the mechanisms inducing these problems, and approaches that could help mitigate them. While collider bias should be explored in existing studies, the optimal way to mitigate the problem is to use appropriate sampling strategies at the study design stage.},

Using the self-selected data from this public forum, we examine the relations between quality, easiness, and sexiness for 3190 professors at 25 universities. For faculty with at least ten student posts, the correlation between quality and easiness is 0.61, and the correlation between quality and sexiness is 0.30. Using simple linear regression, we find that about half of the variation in quality is a function of easiness and sexiness. When grouped into sexy and non-sexy professors, the data reveal that students give sexy-rated professors higher quality and easiness scores. If these findings reflect the thinking of American college students when they complete in-class student opinion surveys, then universities need to rethink the validity of student opinion surveys as a measure of teaching effectiveness. High student opinion survey scores might well be viewed with suspicion rather than reverence, since they might indicate a lack of rigor, little student learning, and grade inflation.},

Groups who kept their cellphones received distracting text messages during the lecture. Participants were quizzed on the lecture. Quiz questions were divided into four segments depending on when the material was presented. Lastly, participants' nomophobia—the fear of being without access to one's cellphone—was assessed. Participants who kept their cellphone performed worse on the quiz for material presented in the 3rd quarter of the lecture than those without cellphones. Distracted participants performed worse on the test for the same material than those who were not distracted. Participants higher in nomophobia, especially on subscales having to do with losing connectedness and giving up convenience, performed worse on the quiz for material that occurred in the 3rd quarter of the lecture. Findings indicate that having cellphones in a short lecture has its largest impact on attention and learning 10–15 min into the lecture.

The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers’ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.},

Lab and web-in-lab data were both acquired in an in-lab setting with lab using “Gold Standard” methods, while web-in-lab used web technology. This allowed for a direct comparison of potential differences in acquisition software. To account for additional environmental differences, the web technology experiments were published online to participate from home (setting web), thereby keeping the software and experimental design identical and only changing the environmental setting. Our main results are: First, we found an expected fixed additive timing offset when using web technology (M = 37 ms, {SD} = 8.14) and recording online (M = 87 ms, {SD} = 16.04) in comparison to lab data. Second, all task-specific effects were reproduced except for the priming paradigm, which couldn’t be replicated in any setting. Third, there were no differences in error rates, which are independent of the timing offset. This finding further supports the assumption of data equality over all settings. Fourth, we found that browser type might be influencing absolute reaction times. Together, these results contribute to the slowly but steadily growing literature that online psychophysics is a suitable complement – or even substitute – to lab data acquisition.},

	abstract = {The use of significance tests in science has been debated from the invention of these tests until the present time. Apart from theoretical critiques on their appropriateness for evaluating scientific hypotheses, significance tests also receive criticism for inviting misinterpretations. We presented six common misinterpretations to psychologists who work in German universities and found out that they are still surprisingly widespread –even among instructors who teach statistics to psychology students. Although these misinterpretations are well documented among students, until now there has been little research on pedagogical methods to remove them. Rather, they are considered “hard facts” that are impervious to correction. We discuss the roots of these misinterpretations and propose a pedagogical concept to teach significance tests, which involves explaining the meaning of statistical significance in an appropriate way.},

Late onset of alcohol use was associated with a lower probability of first intoxication: the risk dropped by a factor 0.81 per year. Early onset of alcohol use was associated with sociodemographic variables, other ‘problem behaviours' like truancy and the drinking behaviour of peers and parents. Respondents with parents who discouraged or forbade alcohol use were at lower risk of early onset of alcohol use. More boys than girls started drinking and got drunk at an early age, and their risk profiles differed.Conclusions Prevention activities should start at the young age of 11 or 12 years, should be sensitive to differences between girls and boys and should involve the parents.},

	abstract = {Teasdale and Jennett first presented the Glasgow Coma Scale in 1974 as an aid in the clinical assessment of unconsciousness. It was devised as a formal scheme to overcome the ambiguities and misunderstandings that arose when information about comatose patients was presented and groups of patients were compared. Since then, the Glasgow Coma Scale has been used extensively, being used to grade individual patients, compare effectiveness of treatments, and as a prognostic indicator. It has been incorporated into numerous trauma and critical illness classification systems. However, a number of competing scales have been developed to overcome its perceived deficiencies. These scales are generally more complex. One of the expressed reservations regarding the Glasgow Coma Scale has been its failure to incorporate brainstem reflexes. The scale also includes a numerical skew toward the motor response. An important current issue is the appropriate application of the Glasgow Coma Scale to intubated patients. A number of approaches have been used to assign the verbal score to such patients. The timing of initial scoring is another area of discussion. Despite its drawbacks, the Glasgow Coma Scale remains the most universally utilized level of consciousness scale worldwide. It seems destined to be used in emergency medicine for some time.},

	abstract = {With the increase in the amount of data captured during the manufacturing process, monitoring systems are becoming important factors in decision making for management. Current technologies such as Internet of Things ({IoT})-based sensors can be considered a solution to provide efficient monitoring of the manufacturing process. In this study, a real-time monitoring system that utilizes {IoT}-based sensors, big data processing, and a hybrid prediction model is proposed. Firstly, an {IoT}-based sensor that collects temperature, humidity, accelerometer, and gyroscope data was developed. The characteristics of {IoT}-generated sensor data from the manufacturing process are: real-time, large amounts, and unstructured type. The proposed big data processing platform utilizes Apache Kafka as a message queue, Apache Storm as a real-time processing engine and {MongoDB} to store the sensor data from the manufacturing process. Secondly, for the proposed hybrid prediction model, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise ({DBSCAN})-based outlier detection and Random Forest classification were used to remove outlier sensor data and provide fault detection during the manufacturing process, respectively. The proposed model was evaluated and tested at an automotive manufacturing assembly line in Korea. The results showed that {IoT}-based sensors and the proposed big data processing system are sufficiently efficient to monitor the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid prediction model has better fault prediction accuracy than other models given the sensor data as input. The proposed system is expected to support management by improving decision-making and will help prevent unexpected losses caused by faults during the manufacturing process.},

Despite the emerging importance of {AI} systems in defense modernization initiatives, there has been little empirical or theoretical study from the perspective of the international relations ({IR}) and security studies fields. This article addresses this shortcoming by describing {AI} developments and assessing the manner in which {AI} is likely to affect military organizations. We focus specifically on military power, as new methods and modes thereof will alter the constitution of security relationships around the world and affect the ability of states to bargain, signal, and influence in the twenty-first century. We argue that, though rapid adoption of {AI} technologies stands to transform states’ ways of war on a number of fronts, an {AI} revolution brings with it new forms of risk that must be reconciled with the widespread integration of algorithmic systems across military functions. Where new technology promises a transformation of the character of military power in some veins, it also complicates the cognitive aspects of decision-making and bureaucratic interactions in security institutions. The speed with which complex integrated {AI} systems enable entirely new modes of war also stands to detach human agency in a potentially destabilizing fashion from the conduct of warfare on several fronts. Preventing the negative externalities of these “ghosts in the machine” will involve significant efforts to educate decision makers, promote accountability, and restrain irresponsible employment of {AI}.},

	abstract = {On March 8, 2020, there was a 650\% increase in Twitter retweets using the term “Chinese virus” and related terms. On March 9, there was an 800\% increase in the use of these terms in conservative news media articles. Using data from non-Asian respondents of the Project Implicit “Asian Implicit Association Test” from 2007–2020 (n = 339,063), we sought to ascertain if this change in media tone increased bias against Asian Americans. Local polynomial regression and interrupted time-series analyses revealed that Implicit Americanness Bias—or the subconscious belief that European American individuals are more “American” than Asian American individuals—declined steadily from 2007 through early 2020 but reversed trend and began to increase on March 8, following the increase in stigmatizing language in conservative media outlets. The trend reversal in bias was more pronounced among conservative individuals. This research provides evidence that the use of stigmatizing language increased subconscious beliefs that Asian Americans are “perpetual foreigners.” Given research that perpetual foreigner bias can beget discriminatory behavior and that experiencing discrimination is associated with adverse mental and physical health outcomes, this research sounds an alarm about the effects of stigmatizing media on the health and welfare of Asian Americans.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13600},
	abstract = {Vaccination against {COVID}-19 with the recently approved {mRNA} vaccines {BNT}162b2 ({BioNTech}/Pfizer) and {mRNA}-1273 (Moderna) is currently underway in a large number of countries. However, high incidence rates and rapidly spreading {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants are concerning. In combination with acute supply deficits in Europe in early 2021, the question arises of whether stretching the vaccine, for instance by delaying the second dose, can make a significant contribution to preventing deaths, despite associated risks such as lower vaccine efficacy, the potential emergence of escape mutants, enhancement, waning immunity, reduced social acceptance of off-label vaccination, and liability shifts. A quantitative epidemiological assessment of risks and benefits of non-standard vaccination protocols remains elusive. To clarify the situation and to provide a quantitative epidemiological foundation we develop a stochastic epidemiological model that integrates specific vaccine rollout protocols into a risk-group structured infectious disease dynamical model. Using the situation and conditions in Germany as a reference system, we show that delaying the second vaccine dose is expected to prevent deaths in the four to five digit range, should the incidence resurge. We show that this considerable public health benefit relies on the fact that both {mRNA} vaccines provide substantial protection against severe {COVID}-19 and death beginning 12 to 14 days after the first dose. The benefits of protocol change are attenuated should vaccine compliance decrease substantially. To quantify the impact of protocol change on vaccination adherence we performed a large-scale online survey. We find that, in Germany, changing vaccination protocols may lead to small reductions in vaccination intention. In sum, we therefore expect the benefits of a strategy change to remain substantial and stable.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom ({FC}) inverts the traditional classroom by having students participate in passive aspects of learning at home and active aspects of learning in class with the guide of an instructor. The introductory statistics course for nonmath majors may be especially suited to the {FC} model given its unique challenges as a required course for students with varying mathematical skills and background. For example, these students often have low interest and high statistics-related anxiety. Recent studies suggest the {FC} for introductory statistics courses leads to increased performance relative to a traditional lecture-based classroom ({LC}). This meta-analysis compared the academic performance of students in introductory statistics courses for nonmath majors who were taught in a {FC} versus those taught in a {LC}. Results indicate that students in the {FC} had statistically discernibly higher final performance outcomes compared to the {LC} delivery with an average difference of 6.9\% in performance (Hedge’s g = 0.43), though there was evidence of moderation by the presence of weekly in-class quizzes. These findings suggest that implementing the {FC} within the introductory statistics classroom at the undergraduate level may improve learning achievement, but more research is needed to explore the role of regular class quizzes.

We introduce a novel approach to apply extreme value theory to fat-tailed variables that have a remote, but nonetheless finite upper bound, by defining a corresponding unbounded dual distribution (given that potential war casualties are bounded by the world population). We apply methods from extreme value theory on the dual distribution and derive its tail properties. The dual method allows us to calculate the real mean of war casualties, which proves to be considerably larger than the sample mean, meaning severe underestimation of the tail risks of conflicts from naive observation. We analyze the robustness of our results to errors in historical reports, taking into account the unreliability of accounts by historians and absence of critical data. We study inter-arrival times between tail events and find that no particular trend can be asserted. All the statistical pictures obtained are at variance with the prevailing claims about "long peace", namely that violence has been declining over time.},

	abstract = {In the 1990s, statisticians began thinking in a principled way about how computation could better support the learning and doing of statistics. Since then, the pace of software development has accelerated, advancements in computing and data science have moved the goalposts, and it is time to reassess. Software continues to be developed to help do and learn statistics, but there is little critical evaluation of the resulting tools, and no accepted framework with which to critique them. This paper presents a set of attributes necessary for a modern statistical computing tool. The framework was designed to be broadly applicable to both novice and expert users, with a particular focus on making more supportive statistical computing environments. A modern statistical computing tool should be accessible, provide easy entry, privilege data as a first-order object, support exploratory and confirmatory analysis, allow for flexible plot creation, support randomization, be interactive, include inherent documentation, support narrative, publishing, and reproducibility, and be flexible to extensions. Ideally, all these attributes could be incorporated into one tool, supporting users at all levels, but a more reasonable goal is for tools designed for novices and professionals to `reach across the gap,' taking inspiration from each others' strengths.},

The interpretation of the resulting models, however, remains the same as if they had been fitted by classical methods. Boosting, hence, allows to use an advanced machine learning scheme to estimate various types of statistical models. This tutorial aims to highlight how boosting can be used for semi-parametric modelling, what practical implications follow from the design of the algorithm and what kind of drawbacks data analysts have to expect. We illustrate the application of boosting in the analysis of a stunting score from children in India and a high-dimensional dataset of tumour {DNA} to develop a biomarker for the occurrence of metastases in breast cancer patients.},

	abstract = {Causal inference is the study of how actions, interventions, or treatments affect outcomes of interest. The methods that have received the lion’s share of attention in the data science literature for establishing causation are variations of randomized experiments. Unfortunately, randomized experiments are not always feasible for a variety of reasons, such as an inability to fully control the treatment assignment, high cost, and potential negative impacts. In such settings, statisticians and econometricians have developed methods for extracting causal estimates from observational (i.e., nonexperimental) data. Data scientists’ adoption of observational study methods for causal inference, however, has been rather slow and concentrated on a few specific applications. In this article, we attempt to catalyze interest in this area by providing case studies of how data scientists used observational studies to deliver valuable insights at {LinkedIn}. These case studies employ a variety of methods, and we highlight some themes and practical considerations. Drawing on our learnings, we then explain how firms can develop an organizational culture that embraces causal inference by investing in three key components: education, automation, and certification.},

Although bullshit-sensitivity has been linked to other individual difference measures, it has not yet been shown to predict any actual behavior. We therefore conducted a survey study with over a thousand participants from a general sample of the Swedish population and assessed participants’ bullshit-receptivity (i.e. their perceived meaningfulness of seven bullshit sentences) and profoundness-receptivity (i.e. their perceived meaningfulness of seven genuinely profound sentences), and used these variables to predict two types of prosocial behavior (self-reported donations and a decision to volunteer for charity). Despite bullshit-receptivity and profoundness-receptivity being positively correlated with each other, logistic regression analyses showed that profoundness-receptivity had a positive association whereas bullshit-receptivity had a negative association with both types of prosocial behavior. These relations held up for the most part when controlling for potentially intermediating factors such as cognitive ability, time spent completing the survey, sex, age, level of education, and religiosity. The results suggest that people who are better at distinguishing the pseudo-profound from the actually profound are more prosocial.},

	abstract = {This book was written for statisticians, computer scientists, geographers, researchers, and others interested in visualizing data. It presents a unique foundation for producing almost every quantitative graphic found in scientific journals, newspapers, statistical packages, and data visualization systems. While the tangible results of this work have been several visualization software libraries, this book focuses on the deep structures involved in producing quantitative graphics from data. What are the rules that underlie the production of pie charts, bar charts, scatterplots, function plots, maps, mosaics, and radar charts? Those less interested in the theoretical and mathematical foundations can still get a sense of the richness and structure of the system by examining the numerous and often unique color graphics it can produce. The second edition is almost twice the size of the original, with six new chapters and substantial revision. Much of the added material makes this book suitable for survey courses in visualization and statistical graphics. From reviews of the first edition: "Destined to become a landmark in statistical graphics, this book provides a formal description of graphics, particularly static graphics, playing much the same role for graphics as probability theory played for statistics." Journal of the American Statistical Association "Wilkinson’s careful scholarship shows around every corner. This is a tour de force of the highest order." Psychometrika "All geography and map libraries should add this book to their collections; the serious scholar of quantitative data graphics will place this book on the same shelf with those by Edward Tufte, and volumes by Cleveland, Bertin, Monmonier, {MacEachren}, among others, and continue the unending task of proselytizing for the best in statistical data presentation by example and through scholarship like that of Leland Wilkinson." Cartographic Perspectives "In summary, this is certainly a remarkable book and a new ambitious step for the development and application of statistical graphics." Computational Statistics and Data Analysis About the author: Leland Wilkinson is Senior {VP}, {SPSS} Inc. and Adjunct Professor of Statistics at Northwestern University. He is also affiliated with the Computer Science department at The University of Illinois at Chicago. He wrote the {SYSTAT} statistical package and founded {SYSTAT} Inc. in 1984. Wilkinson joined {SPSS} in a 1994 acquisition and now works on research and development of visual analytics and statistics. He is a Fellow of the {ASA}.

With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome, publication-quality plots, with automatic legends created from the plot specification superpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots to name a few) from different data sources, with automatically adjusted common scales add customisable smoothers that use the powerful modelling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalised additive models and robust regression save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements, and that can easily be applied to multiple plots approach your graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying their data in an informative and attractive way. You will need some basic knowledge of R (i.e. you should be able to get your data into R), but ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. Hadley Wickham is an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Rice University, and is interested in developing computational and cognitive tools for making data preparation, visualization, and analysis easier.

	abstract = {In the 1990s, statisticians began thinking in a principled way about how computation could better support the learning and doing of statistics. Since then, the pace of software development has accelerated, advancements in computing and data science have moved the goalposts, and it is time to reassess. Software continues to be developed to help do and learn statistics, but there is little critical evaluation of the resulting tools, and no accepted framework with which to critique them. This article presents a set of attributes necessary for a modern statistical computing tool. The framework was designed to be broadly applicable to both novice and expert users, with a particular focus on making more supportive statistical computing environments. A modern statistical computing tool should be accessible, provide easy entry, privilege data as a first-order object, support exploratory and confirmatory analysis, allow for flexible plot creation, support randomization, be interactive, include inherent documentation, support narrative, publishing, and reproducibility, and be flexible to extensions. Ideally, all these attributes could be incorporated into one tool, supporting users at all levels, but a more reasonable goal is for tools designed for novices and professionals to “reach across the gap,” taking inspiration from each others’ strengths.},

	abstract = {One may wonder why methylxanthines are so abundant in beverages used  by humans for centuries, or in cola-drinks that have been heavily consumed since their appearance. It is likely that humans have stuck to any brew containing compounds with psychoactive properties, resulting in a better daily life, i.e., more efficient thinking, exploring, hunting, etc., however, without the serious side effects of drugs of abuse. The physiological effects of methylxanthines have been known for a long time and they are mainly mediated by the so-called adenosine receptors. Caffeine and theobromine are the most abundant methylxanthines in cacao and their physiological effects are notable. Their health-promoting benefits are so remarkable that chocolate is explored as a functional food. The consequences of adenosine receptor blockade by natural compounds present in cacao/chocolate are here reviewed. Palatability and health benefits of methylxanthines,  in general, and theobromine, in particular, have further contributed to sustain one of the most innocuous and pleasant habits: chocolate consumption.},

The investigations of the 2016 {US} presidential elections have brought the existence of external campaigns to light aiming at affecting the general political public opinion. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar influence on political elections can be observed in Europe as well. To this end, we use the past German federal election as an indicator and inspect the propaganda on Twitter, based on data from a period of 268 days. We find that 79 trolls from the {US} campaign have also acted upon the German federal election spreading right-wing views. Moreover, we develop a detector for finding automated behavior that enables us to identify 2,414 previously unknown bots.},

Geometrisch als Teil der Gaußschen Zahlenebene interpretiert, ist die Mandelbrotmenge ein Fraktal, das im allgemeinen Sprachgebrauch oft Apfelmännchen genannt wird. Bilder davon können erzeugt werden, indem ein Pixelraster auf die Zahlenebene gelegt und so jedem Pixel ein Wert von 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle c\}
   zugeordnet wird. Wenn die Folge mit dem entsprechenden 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle c\}
   beschränkt ist, es also zur Mandelbrotmenge gehört, wird das Pixel z. B. schwarz gefärbt, und ansonsten weiß. Wird stattdessen die Farbe danach bestimmt, wie viele Folgenelemente berechnet werden müssen, bis feststeht, dass die Folge nicht beschränkt ist, entsteht ein sog.

Die ersten computergrafischen Darstellungen wurden 1978 von Robert Brooks und Peter Matelski vorgestellt. 1980 veröffentlichte Benoît Mandelbrot eine Arbeit über das Thema. Später wurde sie von Adrien Douady und John Hamal Hubbard in einer Reihe grundlegender mathematischer Arbeiten systematisch untersucht. Die mathematischen Grundlagen dafür wurden bereits 1905 von dem französischen Mathematiker Pierre Fatou erarbeitet.},

We present a case study of an introductory undergraduate course in data science that is designed to address these needs. Offered at Duke University, this course has no prerequisites and serves a wide audience of aspiring statistics and data science majors as well as humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences students. We discuss the unique set of challenges posed by offering such a course, and in light of these challenges, we present a detailed discussion into the pedagogical design elements, content, structure, computational infrastructure, and the assessment methodology of the course.

	abstract = {Statisticians are increasingly posed with thought-provoking and even paradoxical questions, challenging our qualifications for entering the statistical paradises created by Big Data. By developing measures for data quality, this article suggests a framework to address such a question: “Which one should I trust more: a 1\% survey with 60\% response rate or a self-reported administrative dataset covering 80\% of the population?” A 5-element Euler-formula-like identity shows that for any dataset of size nnn, probabilistic or not, the difference between the sample average X⎯⎯⎯⎯{nX}¯n{\textbackslash}overline\{X\}\_\{n\} and the population average X⎯⎯⎯⎯{NX}¯N{\textbackslash}overline\{X\}\_\{N\} is the product of three terms: (1) a data quality measure, ρR,{XρR},X{\textbackslash}rho\_\{\{R,X\}\}, the correlation between {XjXjX}\_\{j\} and the response/recording indicator {RjRjR}\_\{j\}; (2) a data quantity measure, (N−n)/n‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√(N−n)/n{\textbackslash}sqrt\{(N-n)/n\}, where {NNN} is the population size; and (3) a problem difficulty measure, σ{XσX}{\textbackslash}sigma\_\{X\}, the standard deviation of {XXX}. This decomposition provides multiple insights: (I) Probabilistic sampling ensures high data quality by controlling ρR,{XρR},X{\textbackslash}rho\_\{\{R,X\}\} at the level of N−1/2N−1/2N{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\}; ({II}) When we lose this control, the impact of {NNN} is no longer canceled by ρR,{XρR},X{\textbackslash}rho\_\{\{R,X\}\}, leading to a Law of Large Populations ({LLP}), that is, our estimation error, relative to the benchmarking rate 1/n‾√1/n1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}, increases with N‾‾√N{\textbackslash}sqrt\{N\}; and ({III}) the “bigness” of such Big Data (for population inferences) should be measured by the relative size f=n/Nf=n/Nf=n/N, not the absolute size nnn; ({IV}) When combining data sources for population inferences, those relatively tiny but higher quality ones should be given far more weights than suggested by their sizes. Estimates obtained from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study ({CCES}) of the 2016 {US} presidential election suggest a ρR,X≈−0.005{ρR},X≈−0.005{\textbackslash}rho\_\{\{R,X\}\}{\textbackslash}approx-0.005 for self-reporting to vote for Donald Trump. Because of {LLP}, this seemingly minuscule data defect correlation implies that the simple sample proportion of the self-reported voting preference for Trump from 1\%1\%1{\textbackslash}\% of the {US} eligible voters, that is, n≈2,300,000n≈2,300,000n{\textbackslash}approx2{\textbackslash}mbox\{,\}300{\textbackslash}mbox\{,\}000, has the same mean squared error as the corresponding sample proportion from a genuine simple random sample of size n≈400n≈400n{\textbackslash}approx400, a 99.98\%99.98\%99.98{\textbackslash}\% reduction of sample size (and hence our confidence). The {CCES} data demonstrate {LLP} vividly: on average, the larger the state’s voter populations, the further away the actual Trump vote shares from the usual 95\%95\%95{\textbackslash}\% confidence intervals based on the sample proportions. This should remind us that, without taking data quality into account, population inferences with Big Data are subject to a Big Data Paradox: the more the data, the surer we fool ourselves.},

	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3686009},
	shorttitle = {Regression to the Tail},
	abstract = {The Olympic Games are the largest, highest-profile, and most expensive megaevent hosted by cities and nations. Average sports-related costs of hosting are \$12.0 billion. Non-sports-related costs are typically several times that. Every Olympics since 1960 has run over budget, at an average of 172 percent in real terms, the highest overrun on record for any type of megaproject. The paper tests theoretical statistical distributions against empirical data for the costs of the Games, in order to explain the cost risks faced by host cities and nations. It is documented, for the first time, that cost and cost overrun for the Games follow a power-law distribution. Olympic costs are subject to infinite mean and variance, with dire consequences for predictability and planning. We name this phenomenon "regression to the tail": it is only a matter of time until a new extreme event occurs, with an overrun larger than the largest so far, and thus more disruptive and less plannable. The generative mechanism for the Olympic power law is identified as strong convexity prompted by six causal drivers: irreversibility, fixed deadlines, the Blank Check Syndrome, tight coupling, long planning horizons, and an Eternal Beginner Syndrome. The power law explains why the Games are so difficult to plan and manage successfully, and why cities and nations should think twice before bidding to host. Based on the power law, two heuristics are identified for better decision making on hosting. Finally, the paper develops measures for good practice in planning and managing the Games, including how to mitigate the extreme risks of the Olympic power law.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01273},
	abstract = {We conduct a unique, Amazon {MTurk}-based global experiment to investigate the importance of an exponential-growth prediction bias ({EGPB}) in understanding why the {COVID}-19 outbreak has exploded. The scientific basis for our inquiry is the well-established fact that disease spread, especially in the initial stages, follows an exponential function meaning few positive cases can explode into a widespread pandemic if the disease is sufficiently transmittable. We define prediction bias as the systematic error arising from faulty prediction of the number of cases x-weeks hence when presented with y-weeks of prior, actual data on the same. Our design permits us to identify the root of this under-prediction as an {EGPB} arising from the general tendency to underestimate the speed at which exponential processes unfold. Our data reveals that the "degree of convexity" reflected in the predicted path of the disease is significantly and substantially lower than the actual path. The bias is significantly higher for respondents from countries at a later stage relative to those at an early stage of disease progression. We find that individuals who exhibit {EGPB} are also more likely to reveal markedly reduced compliance with the {WHO}-recommended safety measures, find general violations of safety protocols less alarming, and show greater faith in their government's actions. A simple behavioral nudge which shows prior data in terms of raw numbers, as opposed to a graph, causally reduces {EGPB}. Clear communication of risk via raw numbers could increase accuracy of risk perception, in turn facilitating compliance with suggested protective behaviors.},

	abstract = {The system proposed by {VanderWeele} and Robins for categorization of effect modifiers that are causal nodes in a directed acyclic graph ({DAG}) was not intended to empower {DAGs} to fully represent complex interactions among causes. However, once one has algebraically identified effect modifiers, the {DAG} implies a role for them. The limitations of epidemiologic definitions of “effect modification” are discussed, along with the implications of scale dependency for assessing interactions, where the scale can be either absolute risk, relative risk, or odds. My view is that probabilistic independence leads to the log-complement as a natural scale for interaction, but even that scale does not necessarily admit unambiguous inference. Any 2 direct causes of D are effect modifiers for each other on at least 2 scales, which can make a reasonable person question the utility of the concept. Still, etiologic models for joint effects are important, because most diseases arise through pathways involving multiple factors. I suggest an enhancement in construction of {DAGs} in epidemiology that includes arrow-on-arrow representations for effect modification. Examples are given, some of which depend on scale and some of which do not. An example illustrates possible biologic implications for such an effect modification {DAG}.},

	abstract = {Compared to other types of social networks, criminal networks present particularly hard challenges, due to their strong resilience to disruption, which poses severe hurdles to Law-Enforcement Agencies ({LEAs}). Herein, we borrow methods and tools from Social Network Analysis ({SNA}) to (i) unveil the structure and organization of Sicilian Mafia gangs, based on two real-world datasets, and (ii) gain insights as to how to efficiently reduce the Largest Connected Component ({LCC}) of two networks derived from them. Mafia networks have peculiar features in terms of the links distribution and strength, which makes them very different from other social networks, and extremely robust to exogenous perturbations. Analysts also face difficulties in collecting reliable datasets that accurately describe the gangs’ internal structure and their relationships with the external world, which is why earlier studies are largely qualitative, elusive and incomplete. An added value of our work is the generation of two real-world datasets, based on raw data extracted from juridical acts, relating to a Mafia organization that operated in Sicily during the first decade of 2000s. We created two different networks, capturing phone calls and physical meetings, respectively. Our analysis simulated different intervention procedures: (i) arresting one criminal at a time (sequential node removal); and (ii) police raids (node block removal). In both the sequential, and the node block removal intervention procedures, the Betweenness centrality was the most effective strategy in prioritizing the nodes to be removed. For instance, when targeting the top 5\% nodes with the largest Betweenness centrality, our simulations suggest a reduction of up to 70\% in the size of the {LCC}. We also identified that, due the peculiar type of interactions in criminal networks (namely, the distribution of the interactions’ frequency), no significant differences exist between weighted and unweighted network analysis. Our work has significant practical applications for perturbing the operations of criminal and terrorist networks.},

	abstract = {Observational data on {COVID}-19 including hypothesised risk factors for infection and progression are accruing rapidly, often from non-random sampling such as hospital admissions, targeted testing or voluntary participation. Here, we highlight the challenge of interpreting observational evidence from such samples of the population, which may be affected by collider bias. We illustrate these issues using data from the {UK} Biobank in which individuals tested for {COVID}-19 are highly selected for a wide range of genetic, behavioural, cardiovascular, demographic, and anthropometric traits. We discuss the sampling mechanisms that leave aetiological studies of {COVID}-19 infection and progression particularly susceptible to collider bias. We also describe several tools and strategies that could help mitigate the effects of collider bias in extant studies of {COVID}-19 and make available a web app for performing sensitivity analyses. While bias due to non-random sampling should be explored in existing studies, the optimal way to mitigate the problem is to use appropriate sampling strategies at the study design stage.},

After exploring the concepts of interpretability, you will learn about simple, interpretable models such as decision trees, decision rules and linear regression. Later chapters focus on general model-agnostic methods for interpreting black box models like feature importance and accumulated local effects and explaining individual predictions with Shapley values and {LIME}.

All interpretation methods are explained in depth and discussed critically. How do they work under the hood? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How can their outputs be interpreted? This book will enable you to select and correctly apply the interpretation method that is most suitable for your machine learning project.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

Applying such technologies (often referred to as big data technologies) to an ever growing number and variety of internal and external data sources, businesses and institutions can discover hidden correlations between data items, and extract actionable insights needed for innovation and economic growth. While on one hand big data technologies yield great promises, on the other hand, they raise critical security, privacy, and ethical issues, which if left unaddressed may become significant barriers to the fulfillment of expected opportunities and long-term success of big data. In this paper, we discuss the benefits of big data to individuals and society at large, focusing on seven key use cases: Big data for business optimization and customer analytics, big data and science, big data and health care, big data and finance, big data and the emerging energy distribution systems, big/open data as enablers of openness and efficiency in government, and big data security. In addition to benefits and opportunities, we discuss the security, privacy, and ethical issues at stake.},

	abstract = {We are awash in information but are losing our ability to separate fact, fiction, and opinion. The spread of misinformation online has been named one of the top ten challenges facing the world today. This review describes the impacts of fake news, the psychological, social, ideological, and institutional factors that make people susceptible to being deceived, and the multifaceted efforts to combat this “information warfare.” We conclude that it is unlikely that any single approach would be successful in significantly curbing the effect and spreading of “fake news.” In fact, it may take a combination of many different approaches (both human and robotic), drawn from many different disciplines (e.g., psychology, sociology, behavioral economics, communication, computer science, epidemiology, etc.) to overcome the shortcomings of any single method discussed in this chapter. We give special consideration to a strategy based on a theory of inoculation that arms the individual with motivation to think critically, some relevant defense material (content), and guided practice in the defense of one's attitudes. Recent research has shown that inoculation also boosts the individual's perceived self-efficacy, attitude certainty and accessibility, associative networks, affect, issue (topic or attitude) involvement, and source derogation. We suggest that inoculation is a robust strategy that can be used to counter not only the negative effects of “fake news,” but also attitude polarization. More research is needed to determine effective strategies in preventing the spread of false information with intent to harm. Vigilance and detection training for the public and media systems, including inoculation, appear to be valuable tools, but need additional testing in applied settings. The expanding interest in automated or hybrid human-computer detection systems are a good sign that the tech industry is adapting to the faults of current protocols to thwart “fake news.”},

The current online ecosystem has been designed predominantly to capture user attention rather than to promote deliberate cognition and autonomous choice; information overload, finely tuned personalization and distorted social cues, in turn, pave the way for manipulation and the spread of false information. How can transparency and autonomy be promoted instead, thus fostering the positive potential of the web? Effective web governance informed by behavioural research is critically needed to empower individuals online. We identify technologically available yet largely untapped cues that can be harnessed to indicate the epistemic quality of online content, the factors underlying algorithmic decisions and the degree of consensus in online debates. We then map out two classes of behavioural interventions—nudging and boosting— that enlist these cues to redesign online environments for informed and autonomous choice.},

Participants (n = 468) were randomly assigned to read a scenario where 1) an immigrant or 2) an immigrant and their child were caught illegally crossing the southern border of the United States, and then rated how long they should spend in jail if convicted. Participants reported that they would sentence the immigrant to more jail time than the immigrant and child. Those who sent immigrants to jail for more time also viewed them as socially distant and less human, described immigration in impersonal terms, and endorsed other social harms unrelated to immigration (e.g., the death penalty for convicted murderers). Crucially, endorsed social harms accounted for explained variance beyond simply holding conservative views. We position these data within the current literature on dehumanization theory and immigration issues.},

	abstract = {One of the most controversial elements of political tolerance concerns support for hate speech. We argue that there are two factors that can reduce tolerance for hate speech: 1) moral foundations and 2) party cues. U.S. citizens’ tolerance of hate speech will be reduced when it is framed as a violation of a specific moral foundation, opposed by a political party, or when the morality violation is utilized by party elites. Using two survey experiments, we manipulated the target of hate speech (i.e. Muslims or the American flag), whether the speech violated a moral foundation (i.e. harm or loyalty), and which political party supported or opposed the hate speech in question. For flag burning, moral frames and party cues on their own reduced U.S. citizens’ tolerance relative to a non-political control, while moral frames and party cues were successful in reducing tolerance of anti-Muslim speech compared to a free speech appeal. Partisans were generally responsive to cues from the in-party. We also found instances of moral repackaging, where morally incongruent appeals from the in-party reduced tolerance of flag burning among Democrats. Among Republicans, harm morality decreased tolerance of anti-Muslim speech when invoked by the in-party, but increased tolerance when used by the out-party – an indication of the power of party cues to repackage moral arguments and to trigger backlash. These results provide a better understanding of what factors can affect tolerance for hate speech, providing political leaders and social justice advocates with a roadmap to alleviate this problem.},

	abstract = {The number of storks and the number of human babies delivered are positively correlated (Matthews, 2000). This is a classic example of a spurious correlation which has a causal explanation: a third variable, say economic development, is likely to cause both an increase in storks and an increase in the number of human babies, hence the correlation.1 In this blog post, I discuss a more subtle case of spurious correlation, one that is not of causal but of statistical nature: completely independent processes can be correlated substantially. {AR}(1) processes and random walks Moods, stockmarkets, the weather: everything changes, everything is in flux. The simplest model to describe change is an auto-regressive ({AR}) process of order one. Let \$Y\_t\$ be a random variable where \$t = [1, {\textbackslash}ldots T]\$ indexes discrete time. We write an {AR}(1) process as: where \${\textbackslash}phi\$ gives the correlation with the previous observation, and where \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_t {\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}mathcal\{N\}(0, {\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2)\$. For \${\textbackslash}phi = 1\$ the process is called a random walk. We can simulate from these using the following code: There are, of course, many more. ↩},

	abstract = {Judea Pearl said that much of machine learning is just curve fitting1 — but it is quite impressive how far you can get with that, isn’t it? In this blog post, we will look at the mother of all curve fitting problems: fitting a straight line to a number of points. In doing so, we will engage in some statistical detective work and discover the methods of least squares as well as the Gaussian distribution.2 Fitting a line A straight line in the Euclidean plane is described by an intercept () and a slope (\$b\_1\$), i.e., We are interested in finding the values for \$(b\_0, b\_1)\$, and so we must collect data points \$d = {\textbackslash}\{(x\_1, y\_1), (x\_2, y\_2), {\textbackslash}ldots, (x\_n, y\_n){\textbackslash}\}\$. Data collection is often tedious, so let’s do it one point at a time. The first point is \$P\_1 = (x\_1, y\_1) = (1, 2)\$, and if we plug the values into the equation for the line (i.e., set \$x\_1 = 1\$ and \$y\_1 = 2\$), we get an equation with two unknowns. We call this system of equations underdetermined because we cannot uniquely solve for \$b\_0\$ and \$b\_1\$, but we will have a number of solutions all for which \$b\_1 = 2 - b\_0\$; see Figure 1 on the left. However, if we add another point \$P\_2 = (3, 1)\$, the resulting system of equations becomes We have two equations in two unknowns, and this is determined or identified: there is a unique solution for \$b\_0\$ and \$b\_1\$. After some rearranging, we find \$b\_1 = -0.5\$ and \$b\_0 = 2.5\$. This specifies exactly one line, as you can see in Figure 2 on the right. We could end the blog post here, but that would not be particularly insightful for data analysis problems in which we have more data points. Thus, let’s see where it takes us when we add another point, \$P\_3 = (2, 2)\$. The resulting system of equations becomes which is overdetermined — we cannot fit a line that passes through all three of these points. We can, for example, fit three separate lines, given by two out of three of the equations; see Figure 3. But which of these lines, if any, is the “best” line? (Over)Fitting a curve Lacking justification to choose between any of these three, we could reduce the case to one that we have solved already, which is usually a good strategy in mathematics. In particular, we could try to reduce the overdetermined to the determined case. Above, we noticed that we can exactly solve for the two parameters \$(b\_0, b\_1)\$ using two data points \$\{P\_1, P\_2\}\$. This generalizes such that we can exactly solve for \$p\$ parameters using \$p\$ data points. In the problem above, we have three data points, but only two parameters. Let’s bend the notion of a line a bit — call it curve — and introduce a third parameter \$b\_2\$. But what multiplies this parameter \$b\_2\$ in our equations? It seems we are missing a dimension. To amend this, let’s add a dimension by simply squaring the \$x\$ coordinate such that a new point becomes \$P\_1’ = (y\_1, x\_1, x\_1{\textasciicircum}2)\$. The resulting system of equations is To simplify notation, we can write these equations in matrix algebra. Specifically, we write where we are again interested in solving for the unknown \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{b\}\$. Because this system is determined, we can arrive at the solution by inverting the matrix \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{X\}\$, such that \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{b\} = {\textbackslash}mathbf\{X\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{y\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{X\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ is the inverse of \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{X\}\$. The resulting “line” is shown in Figure 4 on the left. There are two issues with this approach. First, it leads to overfitting, that is, while we explain the data at hand well (in fact, we do so perfectly), it might poorly generalize to new data. For example, this curve is so peculiar (and it would get much more peculiar if we had fitted it to more data in the same way) that it is likely that new points lie far away from it. Second, we haven’t really explained anything. In the words of the great R.A. Fisher: “[T]he objective of statistical methods is the reduction of data. A quantity of data, which usually by its mere bulk is incapable of entering the mind, is to be replaced by relatively few quantities which shall adequately represent […] the relevant information contained in the original data.” (Fisher, 1922, p. 311) By introducing as many parameters as we have data points, no such reduction has taken place. So let’s go back to our original problem: which line should we draw through three, or more generally, any number of points \$n\$? Legendre and the “best fit” Reducing the overdetermined to the determined case did not really work. But there is still one option: reducing it to the underdetermined case. To achieve that, we make the reasonable assumption that each observation is corrupted by noise, such that where (\${\textbackslash}epsilon\_1\$, \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_2\$, \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_3\$) are unobserved quantities3. This introduces another \$n\$ unknowns! Therefore, we have too few equations for too many parameters — our previously overdetermined system becomes underdetermined. However, as we saw above, we cannot uniquely solve an underdetermined system of equations. We have to add more constraints. Adrien-Marie Legendre, of whom favourable pictures are difficult to find, proposed what has become known as the methods of least squares to solve this problem: “Of all the principles which can be proposed for that purpose, I think there is none more general, more exact, and more easy of application, that of which we made use in the preceding researches, and which consists of rendering the sum of squares of the errors a minimum. By this means, there is established among the errors a sort of equilibrium which, preventing the extremes from exerting an undue influence, is very well fitted to reveal that state of the system which most nearly approaches the truth. (Legendre, 1805, p. 72-73) There is only one line that minimizes the sum of squared errors. Thus, by adding this constraint we can uniquely solve the underdetermined system; see the Figure on the right. The development of least squares was a watershed moment in mathematical statistics — Stephen Stigler likens its importance to the development of calculus in mathematics (Stigler, 1986, p. 11). We have now seen, conceptually, how to find the “best” fitting line. But how do we do it mathematically? How do we arrive at the Figure on the right? I will illustrate two approaches: the one proposed by Legendre using optimization, and another one using a geometrical insight. Least squares I: Optimization Our goal is to find the line that minimizes the sum of squared errors. To simplify, we center the data by subtracting the mean from \$y\$ and \$x\$, respectively; i.e., \$y’ = y - {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{n\} {\textbackslash}sum\_\{i=1\}{\textasciicircum}n y\_i\$ and \$x’ = x - {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{n\} {\textbackslash}sum\_\{i=1\}{\textasciicircum}n x\_i\$. This makes it such that the intercept is zero, \$b\_0 = 0\$, and we avoid the need to estimate it. In the following, to avoid cluttering notation, I will omit the apostrophe and assume both \$y\$ and \$x\$ are mean-centered. For a particular observation \$y\_i\$, our line predicts it to be \$x\_i b\_1\$. This implies that the error is \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_i = y\_i - x\_i b\_1\$, and the sum of all squared errors is We want to find the value for \$b\_1\$, call it \${\textbackslash}hat\{b\}\_1\$, that minimizes this quantity; that is, we must solve We could use fancy algorithms like gradient descent, but we can also engage in some good old high school mathematics and minimize the expression analytically. We note that the expression is quadratic, and thus has a single minimum, and this happens when the derivative is zero. Alas, to work! where \${\textbackslash}sum\_\{i=1\}{\textasciicircum}n y\_i x\_i\$ is the (scaled by \$n\$) covariance between x and y, and \${\textbackslash}sum\_\{i=1\}{\textasciicircum}n x\_i{\textasciicircum}2\$ is the (scaled by \$n\$) variance of x.4 Least squares {II}: Projection Another way to think about this problem is geometrically. This requires some linear algebra, and so we better write the system of equations in matrix form. For ease of exposure, we again mean-center the data. First, note that the errors in matrix form yield and that the errors are perpendicular to the x-axis, that is, they are at a 90 degree angle of each other; see the Figure on the left. This means that the dot product of the vector of errors and the x-axis points is zero, i.e., or \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}{\textasciicircum}T {\textbackslash}mathbf\{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} = 0\$, in short. Using this geometric insight, we can derive the least squares solution as follows which yields the same result as above.5 As an important special case, note the least square solution to a system of equations with only the intercept \$b\_0\$ as unknown, i.e., \$y\_i = b\_0\$, yields the mean of \$y\$. It is this fact that Gauss used to justify the Gaussian distribution as an error distribution, see below. Gauss, Laplace, and “how good is best?” The method of least squares yields the “best” fitting line in the sense that it minimizes the sum of squared errors. But without any statements about the stochastic nature of the errors \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{{\textbackslash}epsilon\}\$, the question of “how good is best?” remains unanswered. It was Carl Friedrich Gauss who in 1809 couched the least squares problem in probabilistic terms. Specifically, he assumed that each error term \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_i\$ comes from some distribution \${\textbackslash}phi\$. Using this distribution, the probability (density) of a particular \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_i\$ is large when \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_i\$ is small, that is, when observed and predicted value are close together. Further assuming that the errors are independent and identically distributed, he wanted to find the parameter values which maximize that is, maximize the probability of the errors being small (see also Stigler, 1986, p. 141).6 All that is left now is to find the distribution \${\textbackslash}phi\$. Gauss noticed that he could make some general statements about \${\textbackslash}phi\$, namely that it should be symmetric and have its maximum at 0. He then assumed that the mean should be the best value for summarizing \$n\$ measurements \$(y\_1, {\textbackslash}ldots, y\_n)\$; that is, he assumed that maximizing \${\textbackslash}Omega\$ should lead to the same solution as minimizing the sum of squared errors when we have one unknown.7 With this circularity — to justify least squares, I assume least squares — he proved that the distribution must be of the form where \${\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2\$ is the variance8; see the Figure below for three examples. The distribution has become known as the Gaussian distribution, although — in the spirit of Stigler’s law of eponomy9 — de Moivre and Laplace have discovered it before Gauss (see also Stahl, 2006). Karl Pearson popularized the term normal distribution, an act for which he seems to have shown some regret: “Many years ago I called the Laplace–Gaussian curve the normal curve, which name, while it avoids an international question of priority, has the disadvantage of leading people to believe that all other distributions of frequency are in one sense or another ‘abnormal’.” (Pearson, 1920, p. 25) Using the Gaussian distribution, the maximization problem becomes Note that the value at which \${\textbackslash}Omega\$ takes its maximum does not change when we drop the constants and take logarithms. This results in \$-{\textbackslash}sum\_\{i=1\}{\textasciicircum}n {\textbackslash}epsilon\_i{\textasciicircum}2\$ as being the expression to be maximized, which is the same as minimizing its negation, that is, minimizing the sum of squared errors. The “Newton of France”, Pierre Simone de Laplace, took notice of Gauss’ argument in 1810 and rushed to give the Gaussian error curve a much more beautiful justification. If we take the errors to be themselves aggregates of many (tiny) perturbing influences, then they will be normally distributed by the central limit theorem. So what is this central limit theorem, anyway? The central limit theorem The central limit theorem is one of the most stunning theorems of statistics. In the poetic words of Francis Galton “I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the “Law of Frequency of Error”. The law would have been personified by the Greeks and deified, if they had known of it. It reigns with serenity and in complete self-effacement, amidst the wildest confusion. The huger the mob, and the greater the apparent anarchy, the more perfect is its sway. It is the supreme law of Unreason. Whenever a large sample of chaotic elements are taken in hand and marshalled in the order of their magnitude, an unsuspected and most beautiful form of regularity proves to have been latent all along.” (Galton, 1889, p. 66) The theorem basically says that if you have a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables — what Galton calls “the mob” — and if that sequence has finite variance, than the mean of this sequence, as \$n\$ grows larger and larger — “the greater the apparent anarchy” — will get closer and closer to a normal distribution. As \$n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\$, the mean in fact converges in distribution to the normal distribution.10 Laplace realized that, if one takes the errors in the least squares problem to be themselves aggregates (i.e., means) of small influences, then they will be normally distributed. This provides an elegant justification for the least squares solution. To illustrate, assume that a particular error \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_i\$ is in fact the average of \$m = 500\$ small irregularities that are independent and identically distributed; for instance, assume these influences follow a uniform distributions. Let’s say we have \$n = 200\$ observations, thus 200 individual errors. The R code and Figure below illustrate that the error distribution will tend to be Gaussian. See this interview and Martin Ford’s new book in which he interviews 23 leading voices in {AI}, one of them being Pearl. (The comment about curve fitting is on p. 366). ↩ This blog post was in part inspired by Neil Lawrence’s talk at the Gaussian Process summer school last year. You can view it here. ↩ I think it is fair to say that this ‘error’ is a catch-all term, expressing our ignorance or lack of knowledge. This blog post argues that, by virtue of introducing error, all statistical models are misspecified. ↩ The generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward. Instead of simple derivatives, we have to take partial derivatives, one for each parameter \$b\$. When expressed in matrix form, the solution yields \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{b\} = ({\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}{\textasciicircum}T {\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}){\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}{\textasciicircum}T y\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}\$ is a \$n {\textbackslash}times p\$ matrix and \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{b\}\$ is a \$p {\textbackslash}times 1\$ vector. ↩ The generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward. Simply let \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}\$ to be a \$n {\textbackslash}times p\$ matrix and \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{b\}\$ be a \$p {\textbackslash}times 1\$ vector, where \$p\$ is the number of dimensions. The derivation is exactly the same, except that because \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}{\textasciicircum}T {\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}\$ is not a scalar anymore but a matrix, we have to left-multiply by its inverse. This yields \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{b\} = ({\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}{\textasciicircum}T {\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}){\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}{\textasciicircum}T y\$. ↩ To arrive at this maximization criterion, Gauss used Bayes’ rule. Inspired by Laplace, he assumed a uniform prior over the parameters and chose the mode of the posterior distribution over the parameters as his estimator; this is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation, see also Stigler (2008). ↩ Note that while I have mostly talked about “fitting lines” or “predicting values”, the words used during the discovery of least squares where “summarizing” or “aggregating” observations. For instance, they would say that, absent other information, the mean summarizes the data best while I would, using the language of this blog post, be forced to say the mean predicts the data best. I think that “summarizing” is more adequate than “predict”, especially since we are not predicting out of sample (see also Yarkoni \& Westfall, 2017). ↩ Gauss introduced a different parameterization using precision instead of variance. The parameterization using variance was introduced by Fisher. (Karl Pearson used the standard deviation before.) ↩ The law states that “no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer” (Stigler, 1980, p. 147). ↩ The proof is not difficult, and can be found in Blitzstein \& Hwang (2014, p. 436), which is an amazing book on probability theory full of gems. I wholeheartedly recommend working through Blitzstein’s Stat 110 class — it’s one of the best classes I ever took (online, and in general). ↩},

However, predictive molecular marker profiles for risk stratification and therapy optimization are not yet available for routine clinical assessment.
{METHODS} {AND} {FINDINGS}: Using tissue microarrays, we retrospectively analyzed samples from 364 patients with primary {MM}. We investigated a panel of 70 immunohistochemical ({IHC}) antibodies for cell cycle, apoptosis, {DNA} mismatch repair, differentiation, proliferation, cell adhesion, signaling and metabolism. A marker selection procedure based on univariate Cox regression and multiple testing correction was employed to correlate the {IHC} expression data with the clinical follow-up (overall and recurrence-free survival). The model was thoroughly evaluated with two different cross validation experiments, a permutation test and a multivariate Cox regression analysis. In addition, the predictive power of the identified marker signature was validated on a second independent external test cohort (n=225). A signature of seven biomarkers (Bax, Bcl-X, {PTEN}, {COX}-2, loss of β-Catenin, loss of {MTAP}, and presence of {CD}20 positive B-lymphocytes) was found to be an independent negative predictor for overall and recurrence-free survival in patients with {MM}. The seven-marker signature could also predict a high risk of disease recurrence in patients with localized primary {MM} stage {pT}1-2 (tumor thickness ≤2.00 mm). In particular, three of these markers ({MTAP}, {COX}-2, Bcl-X) were shown to offer direct therapeutic implications.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The seven-marker signature might serve as a prognostic tool enabling physicians to selectively triage, at the time of diagnosis, the subset of high recurrence risk stage I-{II} patients for adjuvant therapy. Selective treatment of those patients that are more likely to develop distant metastatic disease could potentially lower the burden of untreatable metastatic melanoma and revolutionize the therapeutic management of {MM}.},

In clinical trials or community trials, the effect of an intervention is assessed by measuring the number of subjects survived or saved after that intervention over a period of time. The time starting from a defined point to the occurrence of a given event, for example death is called as survival time and the analysis of group data as survival analysis. This can be affected by subjects under study that are uncooperative and refused to be remained in the study or when some of the subjects may not experience the event or death before the end of the study, although they would have experienced or died if observation continued, or we lose touch with them midway in the study. We label these situations as censored observations. The Kaplan-Meier estimate is the simplest way of computing the survival over time in spite of all these difficulties associated with subjects or situations. The survival curve can be created assuming various situations. It involves computing of probabilities of occurrence of event at a certain point of time and multiplying these successive probabilities by any earlier computed probabilities to get the final estimate. This can be calculated for two groups of subjects and also their statistical difference in the survivals. This can be used in Ayurveda research when they are comparing two drugs and looking for survival of subjects.},

Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user defined covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.

One obstacle to the adoption of Bayes factor in psychological science is a lack of guidance and software. Recently, Liang, Paulo, Molina, Clyde, and Berger (2008) developed computationally attractive default Bayes factors for multiple regression designs. We provide a web applet for convenient computation and guidance and context for use of these priors. We discuss the interpretation and advantages of the advocated Bayes factor evidence measures.},

	abstract = {Psychological theories are statements of constraint. The role of hypothesis testing in psychology is to test whether specific theoretical constraints hold in data. Bayesian statistics is well suited to the task of finding supporting evidence for constraint, because it allows for comparing evidence for 2 hypotheses against each another. One issue in hypothesis testing is that constraints may hold only approximately rather than exactly, and the reason for small deviations may be trivial or uninteresting. In the large-sample limit, these uninteresting, small deviations lead to the rejection of a useful constraint. In this article, we develop several Bayes factor 1-sample tests for the assessment of approximate equality and ordinal constraints. In these tests, the null hypothesis covers a small interval of non-0 but negligible effect sizes around 0. These Bayes factors are alternatives to previously developed Bayes factors, which do not allow for interval null hypotheses, and may especially prove useful to researchers who use statistical equivalence testing. To facilitate adoption of these Bayes factor tests, we provide easy-to-use software. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2019 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type {II} errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

This article describes a Bayesian approach to determining sample sizes in the sequential development of interventions. Description: Because sample sizes are related to the likelihood of detecting program effects, large samples are preferred. But in the design and development process that characterizes intervention research, smaller scale studies are usually required to justify more costly, larger scale studies. We present 4 scenarios designed to address common but complex questions regarding sample-size determination and the risk of observing misleading (e.g., false-positive) findings. From a Bayesian perspective, this article describes the use of decision rules composed of different target probabilities and prespecified effect sizes. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to demonstrate a Bayesian approach—which tends to require smaller samples than the classical frequentist approach—in the development of interventions from one study to the next.},

A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent boosting paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such {TreeBoost} models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data.

In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called {XGBoost}, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, {XGBoost} scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

	abstract = {In many ways, the report of a psychology research project contains a recipe. Without accurate descriptions of the ingredients (the manipulations and measures) and the instructions (research design and implementation), it is impossible for others to replicate what you have done. Recently, there has been a growing sense in the social and behavioral sciences that the recipes contained in our research reports often do not serve us well. Recognizing this, in 2006 the Publications and Communications Board (P\&C Board) of the American Psychological Association ({APA}) formed a group, the Journal Article Reporting Standards Working Group ({JARS} Working Group), to look into the issue. This chapter presents what {JARS} recommends for information to include in all reports on new quantitative data collections. However, these all-purpose recommendations contain only brief entries regarding (a) the type of research design one employed and (b) one's basic statistical analyses.

	abstract = {There is an ongoing discussion about the definition of mindfulness including the question whether mindfulness is a one-dimensional or multidimensional construct. Research on the Freiburg mindfulness inventory ({FMI}) has also reflected this debate. We have investigated the psychometric properties of the {FMI}-14-item in an online convenience sample of n=244 individuals (150 female; mean age 28.7 ({SD}=8.76)) with (n=75) and without (n=169) regular meditative training). A simplified version of the beck depression inventory ({BDI}-V) and the trait subscale of the state-trait-anxiety-inventory ({STAI}-T) were used for determining criterion validity. A one-dimensional (α=.83) and an alternative two-dimensional solution (αF1=.77; αF2=.69) of the {FMI}-14 were tested with a confirmatory factor analysis and yielded suboptimal fit indices. An exploratory analysis resulted in a reduced 8-item version of the two-dimensional solution with better fit indices, but low internal consistency (αF1=.71; αF2=.64). The factors could be identified as “Presence” (F1) and “Acceptance” (F2). Further investigation revealed that the substantial negative relationship between mindfulness and anxiety and depression is completely due to the “Acceptance” factor of mindfulness. This suggests that there may be heuristic value in the two-factorial solution, although for practical purposes it seems sufficient to assess mindfulness as one-dimensional construct.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of social networks and microblogging websites, communication between people from different cultural and psychological backgrounds has become more direct, resulting in more and more “cyber”conflicts between these people. Consequently, hate speech is used more and more, to the point where it has become a serious problem invading these open spaces. Hate speech refers to the use of aggressive, violent or offensive language, targeting a specific group of people sharing a common property, whether this property is their gender (i.e., sexism), their ethnic group or race (i.e., racism) or their believes and religion. While most of the online social networks and microblogging websites forbid the use of hate speech, the size of these networks and websites makes it almost impossible to control all of their content. Therefore, arises the necessity to detect such speech automatically and filter any content that presents hateful language or language inciting to hatred. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect hate expressions on Twitter. Our approach is based on unigrams and patterns that are automatically collected from the training set. These patterns and unigrams are later used, among others, as features to train a machine learning algorithm. Our experiments on a test set composed of 2010 tweets show that our approach reaches an accuracy equal to 87.4\% on detecting whether a tweet is offensive or not (binary classification), and an accuracy equal to 78.4\% on detecting whether a tweet is hateful, offensive, or clean (ternary classification).},

	abstract = {Due to the massive increase of user-generated web content, in particular on social media networks where anyone can give a statement freely without any limitations, the amount of hateful activities is also increasing. Social media and microblogging web services, such as Twitter, allowing to read and analyze user tweets in near real time. Twitter is a logical source of data for hate speech analysis since users of twitter are more likely to express their emotions of an event by posting some tweet. This analysis can help for early identification of hate speech so it can be prevented to be spread widely. The manual way of classifying out hateful contents in twitter is costly and not scalable. Therefore, the automatic way of hate speech detection is needed to be developed for tweets in Indonesian language. In this study, we used ensemble method for hate speech detection in Indonesian language. We employed five stand-alone classification algorithms, including Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, Maximum Entropy, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, and two ensemble methods, hard voting and soft voting, on Twitter hate speech dataset. The experiment results showed that using ensemble method can improve the classification performance. The best result is achieved when using soft voting with F1 measure 79.8\% on unbalance dataset and 84.7\% on balanced dataset. Although the improvement is not truly remarkable, using ensemble method can reduce the jeopardy of choosing a poor classifier to be used for detecting new tweets as hate speech or not.},

A quantitative analysis of Twitter data was conducted to better understand user characteristics, but no correlations were found between hateful text and the characteristics of the users who had posted it. However, experiments with a hate speech classifier based on datasets from three different languages showed that combining certain user features with textual features gave slight improvements of classification performance. While the incorporation of user features resulted in varying impact on performance for the different datasets used, user network-related features provided the most consistent improvements.},

	abstract = {Objective
To estimate the proportion of healthcare interventions tested within Cochrane Reviews that are effective according to high-quality evidence.
Methods
We selected a random sample of 2,428 (35\%) of all Cochrane Reviews published between 1 January 2008 and 5 March 2021. We extracted data about interventions within these reviews that were compared with placebo, or no treatment, and whose outcome quality was rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ({GRADE}) system. We calculated the proportion of interventions whose benefits were based on high-quality evidence (defined as having high quality {GRADE} rating for at least one primary outcome, statistically significant positive results, and being judged by review authors as effective. We also calculated the proportion of interventions that suggested harm.
Results
Of 1,567 eligible interventions, 87 (5.6\%) had high-quality evidence supporting their benefits. Harms were measured for 577 (36.8\%) interventions. There was statistically significant evidence for harm in 127 (8.1\%) of these. Our dependence on the reliability of Cochrane author assessments (including their {GRADE} assessments) was the main potential limitation of our study.
Conclusion
More than 9 in 10 healthcare interventions studied within recent Cochrane Reviews are not supported by high-quality evidence, and harms are under-reported.},

Such illusions have been proposed to underlie pseudoscience and superstitious thinking, sometimes leading to disastrous consequences in relation to critical life areas, such as health, finances, and wellbeing. Like optical illusions, they can occur for anyone under well-known conditions. Scientific thinking is the best possible safeguard against them, but it does not come intuitively and needs to be taught. Teaching how to think scientifically should benefit from better understanding of the illusion of causality. In this article, we review experiments that our group has conducted on the illusion of causality during the last 20 years. We discuss how research on the illusion of causality can contribute to the teaching of scientific thinking and how scientific thinking can reduce illusion.},

With the advancement in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the possibilities to predict customer churn has increased significantly. Our proposed methodology, consists of six phases. In the first two phases, data pre-processing and feature analysis is performed. In the third phase, feature selection is taken into consideration using gravitational search algorithm. Next, the data has been split into two parts train and test set in the ratio of 80\% and 20\% respectively. In the prediction process, most popular predictive models have been applied, namely, logistic regression, naive bayes, support vector machine, random forest, decision trees, etc. on train set as well as boosting and ensemble techniques are applied to see the effect on accuracy of models. In addition, K-fold cross validation has been used over train set for hyperparameter tuning and to prevent overfitting of models. Finally, the obtained results on test set have been evaluated using confusion matrix and {AUC} curve. It was found that Adaboost and {XGboost} Classifier gives the highest accuracy of 81.71\% and 80.8\% respectively. The highest {AUC} score of 84\%, is achieved by both Adaboost and {XGBoost} Classifiers which outperforms over others.},

Therefore, it is important for researchers to gain access to bot detection tools that are reliable and easy to use. This paper aims to provide an introductory tutorial of Botometer, a public tool for bot detection on Twitter, for readers who are new to this topic and may not be familiar with programming and machine learning. We introduce how Botometer works, the different ways users can access it, and present a case study as a demonstration. Readers can use the case study code as a template for their own research.

	abstract = {Today's large language models ({LLMs}) routinely generate coherent, grammatical and seemingly meaningful paragraphs of text. This achievement has led to speculation that these networks are -- or will soon become -- "thinking machines", capable of performing tasks that require abstract knowledge and reasoning. Here, we review the capabilities of {LLMs} by considering their performance on two different aspects of language use: 'formal linguistic competence', which includes knowledge of rules and patterns of a given language, and 'functional linguistic competence', a host of cognitive abilities required for language understanding and use in the real world. Drawing on evidence from cognitive neuroscience, we show that formal competence in humans relies on specialized language processing mechanisms, whereas functional competence recruits multiple extralinguistic capacities that comprise human thought, such as formal reasoning, world knowledge, situation modeling, and social cognition. In line with this distinction, {LLMs} show impressive (although imperfect) performance on tasks requiring formal linguistic competence, but fail on many tests requiring functional competence. Based on this evidence, we argue that (1) contemporary {LLMs} should be taken seriously as models of formal linguistic skills; (2) models that master real-life language use would need to incorporate or develop not only a core language module, but also multiple non-language-specific cognitive capacities required for modeling thought. Overall, a distinction between formal and functional linguistic competence helps clarify the discourse surrounding {LLMs}' potential and provides a path toward building models that understand and use language in human-like ways.},

Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

However, bot detection is not an exact science. Quantitative estimates of bot prevalence vary considerably and comparative research is rare. We show that findings on the prevalence and activity of bots on Twitter depend strongly on the methods used to identify automated accounts. We search for bots in political discourses on Twitter, using three different bot detection methods: Botometer, Tweetbotornot and “heavy automation”. We drew a sample of 122,884 unique user Twitter accounts that had produced 263,821 tweets contributing to five political discourses in five Western democracies. While all three bot detection methods classified accounts as bots in all our cases, the comparison shows that the three approaches produce very different results. We discuss why neither manual validation nor triangulation resolves the basic problems, and conclude that social scientists studying the influence of social bots on (political) communication and discourse dynamics should be careful with easy-to-use methods, and consider interdisciplinary research.},

	abstract = {Statisticians and data scientists transform raw data into understanding and insight. Ideally, these insights empower people to act and make better decisions. However, data is often misleading especially when trying to draw conclusions about causality (for example, Simpson’s paradox). Therefore, developing causal thinking in undergraduate statistics and data science programs is important. However, there is very little guidance in the education literature about what topics and learning outcomes, specific to causality, are most important. In this paper, we propose a causality curriculum for undergraduate statistics and data science programs. Students should be able to think causally, which is defined as a broad pattern of thinking that enables individuals to appropriately assess claims of causality based upon statistical evidence. They should understand how the data generating process affects their conclusions and how to incorporate knowledge from subject matter experts in areas of application. Important topics in causality for the undergraduate curriculum include the potential outcomes framework and counterfactuals, measures of association versus causal effects, confounding, causal diagrams, and methods for estimating causal effects.},

In this paper, we investigate whether a similar influence on political elections can be observed in Europe as well. To this end, we use the past German federal election as an indicator and inspect the propaganda on Twitter, based on data from a period of 268 days. We find that 79 trolls from the {US} campaign have also acted upon the German federal election spreading right-wing views. Moreover, we develop a detector for finding automated behavior that enables us to identify 2,414 previously unknown suspicious accounts.},

Sharing data and analysis code makes it easier for other researchers to reuse or check published research. However, these benefits will emerge only if researchers can reproduce the analyses reported in published articles and if data are annotated well enough so that it is clear what all variable and value labels mean. Because most researchers are not trained in computational reproducibility, it is important to evaluate current practices to identify those that can be improved. We examined data and code sharing for Registered Reports published in the psychological literature from 2014 to 2018 and attempted to independently computationally reproduce the main results in each article. Of the 62 articles that met our inclusion criteria, 41 had data available, and 37 had analysis scripts available. Both data and code for 36 of the articles were shared. We could run the scripts for 31 analyses, and we reproduced the main results for 21 articles. Although the percentage of articles for which both data and code were shared (36 out of 62, or 58\%) and the percentage of articles for which main results could be computationally reproduced (21 out of 36, or 58\%) were relatively high compared with the percentages found in other studies, there is clear room for improvement.

Together they define statistics as a scientific field in a way that differentiates it from mathematics and computer science, fields which partner with statistics today but also maintain their separate identities. These "pillars" are presented in their historical context, and some flavor of their development and variety of forms is also given in historical context. The framework of these seven is quite different from the usual ways statistical ideas are arranged, such as in most courses on the subject, and thus they give a new way to think about statistics."--},

	abstract = {Nomophobia and even simply the presence of smartphones has an impact on attention and performance, likely through the cognitive mechanism of reduced working memory capacity. When a smartphone, a personally relevant stimulus, is present, working memory capacity is utilized leading to a reduction in the ability to inhibit responses and therefore difficulty with complex attentional tasks. With the increase in smartphone ownership, especially among young adults in developing nations and their proliferation in undergraduate classrooms, it becomes important to understand their cognitive impact in this demographic of users. Therefore, this study evaluated the impact of the presence of undergraduate students’ smartphones on their performance on a non-verbal reasoning task, as well as a series of simple to complex attentional tasks. A total of 154 Pakistani undergraduate students participated in this study. Results demonstrated that the presence or absence of the students’ smartphones did not affect fluid non-verbal intelligence or simple attentional tasks. However, the level of fear of being without their smartphone was correlated with non-verbal fluid intelligence and simple attention. Importantly, when the students’ smartphones were present, they experienced difficulty with a more complex attentional task, regardless of the level of nomophobia. Given the need for fluid reasoning and the complex nature of most material covered within the undergraduate classroom context, this finding indicates a need for education about the detrimental nature of smartphone presence on complex attention, as well as the relationship between nomophobia and fluid reasoning and attention. Implications also include a need for institutional policies clarifying appropriate use of smartphones in the classroom.},

            This meta-analysis systematically reviewed the evidence on standardized acceptance-/mindfulness-based interventions in {DSM}-5 anxiety disorders. Randomized controlled trials examining Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ({ACT}), Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy ({MBCT}), and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ({MBSR}) were searched via {PubMed}, Central, {PsycInfo}, and Scopus until June 2021. Standardized mean differences ({SMD}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) were calculated for primary outcomes (anxiety) and secondary ones (depression and quality of life). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. We found 23 studies, mostly of unclear risk of bias, including 1815 adults with different {DSM}-5 anxiety disorders. {ACT}, {MBCT} and {MBSR} led to short-term effects on clinician- and patient-rated anxiety in addition to treatment as usual ({TAU}) versus {TAU} alone. In comparison to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ({CBT}), {ACT} and {MBCT} showed comparable effects on both anxiety outcomes, while {MBSR} showed significantly lower effects. Analyses up to 6 and 12 months did not reveal significant differences compared to {TAU} or {CBT}. Effects on depression and quality of life showed similar trends. Statistical heterogeneity was moderate to considerable. Adverse events were reported insufficiently. The evidence suggests short-term anxiolytic effects of acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions. Specific treatment effects exceeding those of placebo mechanisms remain unclear.

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            The effectiveness of most cancer targeted therapies is short lived since tumors evolve and develop resistance. Combinations of drugs offer the potential to overcome resistance, however the number of possible combinations is vast necessitating data-driven approaches to find optimal treatments tailored to a patient’s tumor. {AstraZeneca} carried out 11,576 experiments on 910 drug combinations across 85 cancer cell lines, recapitulating
            in vivo
            response profiles. These data, the largest openly available screen, were hosted by {DREAM} alongside deep molecular characterization from the Sanger Institute for a Challenge to computationally predict synergistic drug pairs and associated biomarkers. 160 teams participated to provide the most comprehensive methodological development and subsequent benchmarking to date. Winning methods incorporated prior knowledge of putative drug target interactions.

Numerous methods have been developed for the task, including a recent proliferation of deep-learning based approaches. A variety of datasets have also been developed, exemplifying various manifestations of the hate-speech detection problem. We present here a large-scale empirical comparison of deep and shallow hate-speech detection methods, mediated through the three most commonly used datasets. Our goal is to illuminate progress in the area, and identify strengths and weaknesses in the current state-of-the-art. We particularly focus our analysis on measures of practical performance, including detection accuracy, computational efficiency, capability in using pre-trained models, and domain generalization. In doing so we aim to provide guidance as to the use of hate-speech detection in practice, quantify the state-of-the-art, and identify future research directions.

However, this approach makes it difficult to identify specific model weak points. It also risks overestimating generalisable model performance due to increasingly well-evidenced systematic gaps and biases in hate speech datasets. To enable more targeted diagnostic insights, we introduce {HateCheck}, a suite of functional tests for hate speech detection models. We specify 29 model functionalities motivated by a review of previous research and a series of interviews with civil society stakeholders. We craft test cases for each functionality and validate their quality through a structured annotation process. To illustrate {HateCheck}'s utility, we test near-state-of-the-art transformer models as well as two popular commercial models, revealing critical model weaknesses.},

This paper systematically reviews textual hate speech detection systems and highlights their primary datasets, textual features, and machine learning models. The results of this literature review are integrated with content analysis, resulting in several themes for 138 relevant papers. This study shows several approaches that do not provide consistent results in various hate speech categories. The most dominant sets of methods combine more than one deep learning model. Moreover, the analysis of several hate speech datasets shows that many datasets are small in size and are not reliable for various tasks of hate speech detection. Therefore, this study provides the research community with insights and empirical evidence on the intrinsic properties of hate speech and helps communities identify topics for future work.},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based "traditional" programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.},

	abstract = {Today, Machine Learning ({ML}) is of a great importance to society due to the availability of huge data and high computational resources. This ultimately led to the introduction of {ML} concepts at multiple levels of education including K-12 students to promote computational thinking. However, teaching these concepts to K-12 through traditional methodologies such as video lectures and books is challenging. Many studies in the literature have reported that using interactive environments such as games to teach computational thinking and programming improves retention capacity and motivation among students. Therefore, introducing {ML} concepts using a game might enhance students' understanding of the subject and motivate them to learn further. However, we are not aware of any existing game which explicitly focuses on introducing {ML} concepts to students using game play. Hence, in this paper, we propose {ML}-Quest, a 3D video game to provide conceptual overview of three {ML} concepts: Supervised Learning, Gradient Descent and K-Nearest Neighbor ({KNN}) Classification. The crux of the game is to introduce the definition and working of these concepts, which we call conceptual overview, in a simulated scenario without overwhelming students with the intricacies of {ML}. The game has been predominantly evaluated for its usefulness and player experience using the Technology Acceptance Model ({TAM}) model with the help of 23 higher-secondary school students. The survey result shows that around 70\% of the participants either agree or strongly agree that the {ML}-Quest is quite interactive and useful in introducing them to {ML} concepts.},

As a result, we encountered 16 tools targeting students mostly as part of short duration extracurricular activities. Tools mainly support the interactive development of {ML} models for image recognition tasks using supervised learning covering basic steps of the {ML} process. Being integrated into popular block-based programming languages (primarily Scratch and App Inventor), they also support the deployment of the created {ML} models as part of games or mobile applications. Findings indicate that the tools can effectively leverage students’ understanding of Machine Learning, however, further studies regarding the design of the tools concerning educational aspects are required to better guide their effective adoption in schools and their enhancement to support the learning process more comprehensively.},

It also teaches the application of these concepts, by guiding the students to develop a first classification model of recycling trash images using Google Teachable Machine. In order to promote {ML} education, the interactive course is available online in Brazilian Portuguese to be used as an extracurricular course or in an interdisciplinary way as part of science classes covering recycling topics. The course was applied and evaluated through a series of exploratory case studies with a total of 108 middle and high school students. The results of the evaluation show that middle and high school students were able to understand {ML} concepts and develop an image classification model. No substantial difference with regard to the educational stage, gender and instructional mode was observed.

The {OASIS} images were collected from online sources, and valence and arousal ratings were obtained in an online study (total N = 822). The valence and arousal ratings covered much of the circumplex space and were highly reliable and consistent across gender groups. {OASIS} has four advantages: (a) the stimulus set contains a large number of images in four categories; (b) the data were collected in 2015, and thus {OASIS} features more current images and reflects more current ratings of valence and arousal than do existing stimulus sets; (c) the {OASIS} database affords users the ability to interactively explore images by category and ratings; and, most critically, (d) {OASIS} allows for free use of the images in online and offline research studies, as they are not subject to the copyright restrictions that apply to the International Affective Picture System.

Eight criteria are suggested and all of these should be met in order to justify the use of unstandardised instruments in applied settings. Finally, it is emphasised that the use of unstandardised instruments should be viewed as temporary and tentative; the final aim of all translations and adaptations of psychological instruments that are to be used in a clinical or other applied context should be proper standardisation.},

	abstract = {While there is an ample amount of consumer behavior research that recruits processing fluency as an explanatory construct, the question how to best measure the fluency experience has received little attention. Therefore, there is a lack of consistency in measuring the construct, particularly with regard to the use of single-item versus multi-item measures. The current research, thus, aims to investigate how processing fluency can be consistently measured across different experimental fluency manipulations and which type of measure has the highest validity. Based on classic scale development procedures, we propose a reliable and valid multi-item measure and compare this measure against a single-item measure in terms of predictive validity. We show that both measures mediate the effect of five established fluency manipulations and that the single-item measure is sufficient. In addition to providing a measure for future research that can be adapted to different empirical settings, we provide empirical evidence on the replicability of fluency effects and on the theoretical conjecture that people have a uniform fluency experience across different manipulations of fluency.

More specifically, the conceptual model explicates the effects of advertised selling and reference prices on buyers' internal reference prices, perceptions of quality, acquisition value, transaction value, and purchase and search intentions. 361 students (aged 18–49 yrs) participated in Exp 1 and 328 university staff (aged 24–62 yrs) participated in Exp 2. Ss in both studies were shown a booklet containing an advertisement for a bicycle. A brand name was used, and selling price levels and advertised reference price levels varied. Results across these 2 studies, both individually and combined, support the hypothesis that buyers' internal reference prices are influenced by both advertised selling and reference prices as well as the buyers' perception of the product's quality. It was also find that the effect of advertised selling price on buyers' acquisition value was mediated by their perceptions of transaction value. In addition, the effects of perceived transaction value on buyers' behavioral intentions were mediated by their acquisition value perceptions. The authors suggest directions for further research and implications for managers. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2018 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The authors report a repeated measures field study that captures complaining customers' perceptions of their overall satisfaction with the firm, likelihood of word-of-mouth recommendations, and repurchase intent during a 20-month span that includes two service failures and recovery attempts. The findings suggest that though satisfactory recoveries can produce a “recovery paradox” after one failure, they do not trigger such paradoxical increases after two failures. Furthermore, “double deviations” can occur following two consecutive unsatisfactory recoveries or following an unsatisfactory recovery in response to a second failure. The findings indicate that customers reporting an unsatisfactory recovery followed by a satisfactory recovery reported significantly higher ratings at the second postrecovery period than did customers reporting the opposite recovery sequence. The outcome of the second recovery also demonstrated a significant influence on customer ratings (positively if the recovery was satisfactory, negatively if the recovery was unsatisfactory), regardless of whether the customer found the first recovery satisfactory or unsatisfactory. In addition, although the increased change in recovery expectations and failure severity ratings from the first failure to the second is more dramatic for customers who previously reported a satisfactory recovery, the increase in attributions of blame toward the firm is more pronounced for customers who previously reported an unsatisfactory recovery. Last, the results show that recovery efforts are attenuated when two similar failures occur and when two failures happen in close time proximity.},

Our exploratory study examines the association between ad-elicited emotional arousal and predetermined ad memorability, as a proxy for memory for the ad. Results reveal greater amygdala activation in memorable (versus unmemorable) ads, reinforcing the association between ad-elicited emotional arousal and memory for the ad. Amygdala activation was accompanied by activation in the brain region termed the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}), which is involved in social cognition. These results are indicative of a sociocognitive emotional memory process, which has been neglected in past research. Future research directions are discussed.},

This lack of information has unforeseen consequences for test-takers and decision making in clinical and other applied settings. In this paper it is argued that there is a need for guidelines outlining the minimum requirements to justify professional and ethical use of unstandardised psychological instruments. Eight criteria are suggested and all of these should be met in order to justify the use of unstandardised instruments in applied settings. Finally, it is emphasised that the use of unstandardised instruments should be viewed as temporary and tentative; the final aim of all translations and adaptations of psychological instruments that are to be used in a clinical or other applied context should be proper standardisation.},

Three subjective scales were used: (1) the {VAS} (continuous scale); (2) the Borg scale (12 fixed points); and (3) the Likert scale ({LS}; 5 fixed points). Four identical submaximal tests were given (2 min at 60\% maximum oxygen uptake [o$_{\textrm{2}}$max] and 6 min at 70\% o$_{\textrm{2}}$max). Two tests were undertaken to assess the reproducibility of scores that were obtained with each subjective scale. Two other tests were undertaken to assess the sensitivity of each scale to a change in symptom perception: a double-blind treatment with propranolol, 80 mg, (\textit{ie}, active therapy; to increase the sensation of breathlessness and general fatigue during exercise) or matching placebo. The subjective scale scores were measured at 1 min 30 s, 5 min 30 s, and 7 min 15 s of exercise. Reproducibility was defined as the proportion of total variance (\textit{ie}, between-subject plus within-subject variance) explained by the between-subject variance given as a percentage.

Specifically, this study employed a 2 (humanization of chatbot agent avatar: hyperrealistic-animated vs. cartoonish-still) × 2 (avatar familiarity: celebrity avatar vs. non-celebrity avatar) between-subjects experiment (N = 185), in which participants were asked to purchase a laptop from an e-commerce vendor by interacting with a chatbot agent. Based on predictions from the uncanny valley effect hypothesis ({UVE}), enhancing the human likeness of a chatbot agent through visual realism and animacy was predicted to negatively influence users’ trust in the chatbot agent and behavioral intention as a consequence of the activation of a negative affective state (i.e., a feeling of eeriness). Consistent with our predictions, the results from {PLS}-{SEM} showed that (a) enhancing the human likeness of a chatbot agent significantly increased users’ feeling of eeriness, (b) the feeling of eeriness negatively influenced users’ trust in the chatbot agent, c) trust, determined by the feeling of eeriness, significantly affected users’ purchase intention and willingness to reuse the chatbot, and d) the relationship between humanization and eeriness significantly moderated by the familiarity of the chatbot avatar. We discuss the theoretical implications of the current study on {UVE} as well as its practical implications for the implementation of anthropomorphized chatbot agents in the e-commerce context.},

Factor analysis of two independent {SUS} data sets reveals that the {SUS} actually has two factors – Usable (8 items) and Learnable (2 items – specifically, Items 4 and 10). These new scales have reasonable reliability (coefficient alpha of .91 and .70, respectively). They correlate highly with the overall {SUS} (r = .985 and .784, respectively) and correlate significantly with one another (r = .664), but at a low enough level to use as separate scales. A sensitivity analysis using data from 19 tests had a significant Test by Scale interaction, providing additional evidence of the differential utility of the new scales. Practitioners can continue to use the current {SUS} as is, but, at no extra cost, can also take advantage of these new scales to extract additional information from their {SUS} data. The data support the use of “awkward” rather than “cumbersome” in Item 8.},

	abstract = {The validity of organizational research relies on strong research methods, which include effective measurement of psychological constructs. The general consensus is that multiple item measures have better psychometric properties than single-item measures. However, due to practical constraints (e.g., survey length, respondent burden) there are situations in which certain single items may be useful for capturing information about constructs that might otherwise go unmeasured. We evaluated 37 items, including 18 newly developed items as well as 19 single items selected from existing multiple-item scales based on psychometric characteristics, to assess 18 constructs frequently measured in organizational and occupational health psychology research. We examined evidence of reliability; convergent, discriminant, and content validity assessments; and test–retest reliabilities at 1- and 3-month time lags for single-item measures using a multistage and multisource validation strategy across 3 studies, including data from N = 17 occupational health subject matter experts and N = 1,634 survey respondents across 2 samples. Items selected from existing scales generally demonstrated better internal consistency reliability and convergent validity, whereas these particular new items generally had higher levels of content validity. We offer recommendations regarding when use of single items may be more or less appropriate, as well as 11 items that seem acceptable, 14 items with mixed results that might be used with caution due to mixed results, and 12 items we do not recommend using as single-item measures. Although multiple-item measures are preferable from a psychometric standpoint, in some circumstances single-item measures can provide useful information.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This study was designed to investigate the revised and short version of the smartphone addiction scale and the proof of its validity in adolescents. In addition, it suggested cutting off the values by gender in order to determine smartphone addiction and elaborate the characteristics of smartphone usage in adolescents.
{METHOD}: A set of questionnaires were provided to a total of 540 selected participants from April to May of 2013. The participants consisted of 343 boys and 197 girls, and their average age was 14.5 years old. The content validity was performed on a selection of shortened items, while an internal-consistency test was conducted for the verification of its reliability. The concurrent validity was confirmed using {SAS}, {SAPS} and {KS}-scale. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was conducted to suggest cut-off.
{RESULTS}: The 10 final questions were selected using content validity. The internal consistency and concurrent validity of {SAS} were verified with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.911. The {SAS}-{SV} was significantly correlated with the {SAS}, {SAPS} and {KS}-scale. The {SAS}-{SV} scores of gender (p{\textless}.001) and self-evaluation of smartphone addiction (p{\textless}.001) showed significant difference. The {ROC} analysis results showed an area under a curve ({AUC}) value of 0.963(0.888-1.000), a cut-off value of 31, sensitivity value of 0.867 and specificity value of 0.893 in boys while an {AUC} value of 0.947(0.887-1.000), a cut-off value of 33, sensitivity value of 0.875, and a specificity value of 0.886 in girls.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The {SAS}-{SV} showed good reliability and validity for the assessment of smartphone addiction. The smartphone addiction scale short version, which was developed and validated in this study, could be used efficiently for the evaluation of smartphone addiction in community and research areas.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem.

	abstract = {The importance of educating the next generations in the understanding of the fundamentals of the upcoming scientific and technological innovations that will force a broad social and economical paradigm change can not be overstressed. One such breakthrough technologies is Artificial Intelligence ({AI}), specifically machine learning algorithms. Nowadays, the public has little understanding of the workings and implications of {AI} techniques that are already entering their lives in many ways. We aim to achieve widespread public understanding of these issues in an experiential learning framework. Following a design based research approach, we propose to implement program coding scaffoldings to teach and experiment some basic mechanisms of {AI} systems. Such experiments would be shedding new light into {AI} potentials and limitations. In this paper we focus on innovative ways to introduce high school students to the fundamentals and operation of two of the most popular {AI} algorithms. We describe the elements of a workshop where we provide an academic use-create-modify scaffolding where students work on the Scratch partial coding of the algorithms so they can explore the behavior of the algorithm, gaining understanding of the underlying computational thinking of {AI} processes. The extent of the impact on the students of this experience is measured through questionnaires filled before and after participation in the workshop. Preliminary experiments offer encouraging results, showing that the workshop has differential impact on the way students understand {AI}.},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of {AI}-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and {AI} in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based “traditional” programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.},

Psychologists have provided several standardized affective stimulus databases—such as the International Affective Picture System ({IAPS}) and the Nencki Affective Picture System ({NAPS}) as visual stimulus databases, as well as the International Affective Digitized Sounds ({IADS}) and the Montreal Affective Voices as auditory stimulus databases for emotional experiments. However, considering the limitations of the existing auditory stimulus database studies, research using auditory stimuli is relatively limited compared with the studies using visual stimuli. First, the number of sample sounds is limited, making it difficult to equate across emotional conditions and semantic categories. Second, some artificially created materials (music or human voice) may fail to accurately drive the intended emotional processes. Our principal aim was to expand existing auditory affective sample database to sufficiently cover natural sounds. We asked 207 participants to rate 935 sounds (including the sounds from the {IADS}-2) using the Self-Assessment Manikin ({SAM}) and three basic-emotion rating scales. The results showed that emotions in sounds can be distinguished on the affective rating scales, and the stability of the evaluations of sounds revealed that we have successfully provided a larger corpus of natural, emotionally evocative auditory stimuli, covering a wide range of semantic categories. Our expanded, standardized sound sample database may promote a wide range of research in auditory systems and the possible interactions with other sensory modalities, encouraging direct reliable comparisons of outcomes from different researchers in the field of psychology.},

There is limited research in the {IT} implementation literature that deals with the role of interventions to aid such managerial decision making. Particularly, there is a need to understand how various interventions can influence the known determinants of {IT} adoption and use. To address this gap in the literature, we draw from the vast body of research on the technology acceptance model ({TAM}), particularly the work on the determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and: (i) develop a comprehensive nomological network (integrated model) of the determinants of individual level ({IT}) adoption and use; (ii) empirically test the proposed integrated model; and (iii) present a research agenda focused on potential pre- and postimplementation interventions that can enhance employees' adoption and use of {IT}. Our findings and research agenda have important implications for managerial decision making on {IT} implementation in organizations.},

Study 2 tested whether psychological factors (Big Five personality traits, corporate distrust, and general trust) predicted attitudes towards {AI}. Introverts had more positive attitudes towards {AI} overall, likely because of algorithm appreciation. Conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with forgiving attitudes towards negative aspects of {AI}. Higher corporate distrust led to negative attitudes towards {AI} overall, while higher general trust led to positive views of the benefits of {AI}.

Through this, we observe humans who embrace technological advances with a positive attitude. Others, however, are particularly sceptical and claim to foresee substantial problems arising from such uses of technology. The aim of the present study was to introduce a short measure to assess the Attitude Towards Artificial Intelligence ({ATAI} scale) in the German, Chinese, and English languages. Participants from Germany (N = 461; 345 females), China (N = 413; 145 females), and the {UK} (N = 84; 65 females) completed the {ATAI} scale, for which the factorial structure was tested and compared between the samples. Participants from Germany and China were additionally asked about their willingness to interact with/use self-driving cars, Siri, Alexa, the social robot Pepper, and the humanoid robot Erica, which are representatives of popular artificial intelligence products. The results showed that the five-item {ATAI} scale comprises two negatively associated factors assessing (1) acceptance and (2) fear of artificial intelligence. The factor structure was found to be similar across the German, Chinese, and {UK} samples. Additionally, the {ATAI} scale was validated, as the items on the willingness to use specific artificial intelligence products were positively associated with the {ATAI} Acceptance scale and negatively with the {ATAI} Fear scale, in both the German and Chinese samples. In conclusion we introduce a short, reliable, and valid measure on the attitude towards artificial intelligence in German, Chinese, and English language.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Botnet has become one of the most dreadful type of malicious entity. Because of the hidden and carrying capacity of Botnet, the detection task has become a real challenge. Different methodologies have been applied for finding the source of Botnet at an early stage. Machine Learning and Deep Learning have greatly impacted these Botnet detection methodologies. But still, it is a difficult task because of the lesser number of features available in the Botnet datasets. In this paper, we have proposed a Fuzzy Logic based feature engineering method. The proposed method first identifies the fuzzy elements in the dataset and then generates fuzzy sets. The features generated using this method is used by an Artificial Neural Network for classification of Botnet. To train and evaluate the {ANN} model, we have used the {CTU}-13 dataset. The proposed feature engineering method and Botnet classification method has performed well with an accuracy of 99.94\%. Still this method needs to be tested on different datasets. In future, new fuzzy rules can also be made to generate a new set of features as well as these rules can be used to generate features from other datasets.},

	abstract = {Twitter bot detection has become an important and challenging task to combat misinformation and protect the integrity of the online discourse. State-of-the-art approaches generally leverage the topological structure of the Twittersphere, while they neglect the heterogeneity of relations and influence among users. In this paper, we propose a novel bot detection framework to alleviate this problem, which leverages the topological structure of user-formed heterogeneous graphs and models varying influence intensity between users. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous information network with users as nodes and diversified relations as edges. We then propose relational graph transformers to model heterogeneous influence between users and learn node representations. Finally, we use semantic attention networks to aggregate messages across users and relations and conduct heterogeneity-aware Twitter bot detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive Twitter bot detection benchmark. Additional studies also bear out the effectiveness of our proposed relational graph transformers, semantic attention networks and the graph-based approach in general.},

The detection of bots has been a major task within the field of social media computation, and many datasets and bot detection algorithms have been developed. With these algorithms, the bot score stability is key in estimating the impact of bots on the diffusion of information. Within several experiments on Twitter agents, we quantify the amount of data required for consistent bot predictions and analyze agent bot classification behavior. Through this study, we developed a methodology to establish parameters for stabilizing the bot probability score through threshold, temporal and volume analysis, eventually quantifying suitable threshold values for bot classification (i.e. whether the agent is a bot or not) and reasonable data collection size (i.e. number of days of tweets or number of tweets) for stable scores and bot classification.},

For instance, the botnet phenomenon is a prominent threat to Internet security, including the threat of malicious codes. The botnet phenomenon supports a wide range of criminal activities, including distributed denial of service ({DDoS}) attacks, click fraud, phishing, malware distribution, spam emails, and building machines for illegitimate exchange of information/materials. Therefore, it is imperative to design and develop a robust mechanism for improving the botnet detection, analysis, and removal process. Currently, botnet detection techniques have been reviewed in different ways; however, such studies are limited in scope and lack discussions on the latest botnet detection techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the latest state-of-the-art techniques for botnet detection and figures out the trends of previous and current research. It provides a thematic taxonomy for the classification of botnet detection techniques and highlights the implications and critical aspects by qualitatively analyzing such techniques. Related to our comprehensive review, we highlight future directions for improving the schemes that broadly span the entire botnet detection research field and identify the persistent and prominent research challenges that remain open.},

	abstract = {The problem of detecting bots, automated social media accounts governed by software but disguising as human users, has strong implications. For example, bots have been used to sway political elections by distorting online discourse, to manipulate the stock market, or to push anti-vaccine conspiracy theories that may have caused health epidemics. Most techniques proposed to date detect bots at the account level, by processing large amounts of social media posts, and leveraging information from network structure, temporal dynamics, sentiment analysis, etc. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based on contextual long short-term memory ({LSTM}) architecture that exploits both content and metadata to detect bots at the tweet level: contextual features are extracted from user metadata and fed as auxiliary input to {LSTM} deep nets processing the tweet text. Another contribution that we make is proposing a technique based on synthetic minority oversampling to generate a large labeled dataset, suitable for deep nets training, from a minimal amount of labeled data (roughly 3000 examples of sophisticated Twitter bots). We demonstrate that, from just one single tweet, our architecture can achieve high classification accuracy ({AUC}  {\textgreater}  96\%) in separating bots from humans. We apply the same architecture to account-level bot detection, achieving nearly perfect classification accuracy ({AUC}  {\textgreater}  99\%). Our system outperforms previous state of the art while leveraging a small and interpretable set of features, yet requiring minimal training data.},

In contrast, the ritual model illustrates the reinforcement of racist attitudes and disparate treatment of minorities that occurs with the repetitive use of hate speech. Although the ritual model serves a heuristic function by providing courts with a framework for understanding harm caused by hate speech, its judicial adoption to determine liability for individual instances of racist or sexist communication raises troublesome First Amendment issues},

The presence of hate speech online is becoming increasingly problematic, making necessary the development of appropriate countermeasures. In this work, we perform hate speech detection on a corpus of more than one million comments on {YouTube} videos through a machine learning model, trained and fine-tuned on a large set of hand-annotated data. Our analysis shows that there is no evidence of the presence of “pure haters”, meant as active users posting exclusively hateful comments. Moreover, coherently with the echo chamber hypothesis, we find that users skewed towards one of the two categories of video channels (questionable, reliable) are more prone to use inappropriate, violent, or hateful language within their opponents’ community. Interestingly, users loyal to reliable sources use on average a more toxic language than their counterpart. Finally, we find that the overall toxicity of the discussion increases with its length, measured both in terms of the number of comments and time. Our results show that, coherently with Godwin’s law, online debates tend to degenerate towards increasingly toxic exchanges of views.},

Such over-reliance on spurious correlations also causes systems to struggle with detecting implicitly toxic language. To help mitigate these issues, we create {ToxiGen}, a new large-scale and machine-generated dataset of 274k toxic and benign statements about 13 minority groups. We develop a demonstration-based prompting framework and an adversarial classifier-in-the-loop decoding method to generate subtly toxic and benign text with a massive pretrained language model. Controlling machine generation in this way allows {ToxiGen} to cover implicitly toxic text at a larger scale, and about more demographic groups, than previous resources of human-written text. We conduct a human evaluation on a challenging subset of {ToxiGen} and find that annotators struggle to distinguish machine-generated text from human-written language. We also find that 94.5\% of toxic examples are labeled as hate speech by human annotators. Using three publicly-available datasets, we show that finetuning a toxicity classifier on our data improves its performance on human-written data substantially. We also demonstrate that {ToxiGen} can be used to fight machine-generated toxicity as finetuning improves the classifier significantly on our evaluation subset.

Deep learning based solutions have been at the forefront of identifying hateful content. However, the factors such as the context-dependent nature of hate speech, the intention of the user, undesired biases, etc. make this process overcritical. In this work, we deeply explore a wide range of challenges in automatic hate speech detection by presenting a hierarchical organization of these problems. We focus on challenges faced by machine learning or deep learning based solutions to hate speech identification. At the top level, we distinguish between data level, model level, and human level challenges. We further provide an exhaustive analysis of each level of the hierarchy with examples.

	abstract = {With the multiplication of social media platforms, which offer anonymity, easy access and online community formation, and online debate, the issue of hate speech detection and tracking becomes a growing challenge to society, individual, policy-makers and researchers. Despite efforts for leveraging automatic techniques for automatic detection and monitoring, their performances are still far from satisfactory, which constantly calls for future research on the issue. This paper provides a systematic review of literature in this field, with a focus on natural language processing and deep learning technologies, highlighting the terminology, processing pipeline, core methods employed, with a focal point on deep learning architecture. From a methodological perspective, we adopt {PRISMA} guideline of systematic review of the last 10 years literature from {ACM} Digital Library and Google Scholar. In the sequel, existing surveys, limitations, and future research directions are extensively discussed.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Exposure to hate speech can have serious consequences for the mental health of immigrants and minority groups. However, not much is known about the process by which this effect takes place and to what extent it is independent of the effects of other forms of discrimination on health. The present study aimed to investigate whether acculturation stress mediates the relationship between exposure to hate speech and mental health and whether the effect would hold after controlling for experienced discrimination. Method: An online survey was conducted among Ukrainian immigrants living in Poland (N = 726) in order to investigate the relation between exposure to hate speech, acculturation stress, and mental health. Mediation analyses were used to test whether exposure to hateful language predicts posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) and depression symptoms and whether these effects are mediated by acculturation stress while controlling for experiences of other forms of discrimination. Results: Exposure to hate speech predicted {PTSD} and depression symptoms. Both effects were mediated by acculturation stress and were significant after controlling for experienced discrimination. Conclusions: The study provides evidence for the existence of a relation between exposure to hate speech among migrants and mental health problems. The study also provides support for a potential mechanism of this effect: acculturation stress and evidence for the fact that the effect holds over and above the effect of discrimination.

	abstract = {Purpose: To compare the validity, reliability and responsiveness of a single, global quality of life question to multi-item scales. Method: Data were obtained from 83 consecutive patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma undergoing either transhiatal or transthoracic oesophagectomy. Quality of life was measured at baseline, 5 weeks, 3 and 12 months post-operatively with a single-item Visual Analogue Scale ({VAS}) ranging from 0 to 100, the multi-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-20 ({MOS} {SF}-20) and Rotterdam Symptom Check-List ({RSCL}). Convergent and discriminant validity, test–retest reliability and both distribution-based and anchor-based responsiveness were evaluated. Major findings: At baseline and at 5 weeks, the {VAS} showed high correlations with the {MOS} {SF}-20 health perceptions scale (r = 0.70 and 0.72) and moderate to high correlations with all other subscales of the {MOS} {SF}-20 and {RSCL} (r = 0.29–0.70). The test–retest reliability intra-class correlation for the {VAS} was 0.87. At 5 weeks post-operatively, the distribution-based responsiveness was moderate for the {VAS} (standardised response mean: −0.47; effect size: −0.56), high for the physical subscales of the {MOS} {SF}-20 and {RSCL} (−1.08 to −1.51) and low for the psychological subscales (0.11 to −0.25). Five weeks post-operatively, anchor-based responsiveness was highest for the {VAS} (r = 0.54). Conclusion: The {VAS} is an instrument with good validity, excellent reliability, moderate distribution-based responsiveness and good anchor-based responsiveness compared to multi-item questionnaires. Its use is recommended in clinical trials to assess global quality of life.},

	abstract = {Purpose The present paper assessed the validity of single-item life satisfaction measures by comparing single-item measures to the Satisfaction with Life Scale ({SWLS})—a more psychometrically established measure. Methods Two large samples from Washington (N = 13,064) and Oregon (N = 2,277) recruited by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and a representative German sample (N = 1,312) recruited by the Germany Socio-Economic Panel were included in the present analyses. Single-item life satisfaction measures and the {SWLS} were correlated with theoretically relevant variables, such as demographics, subjective health, domain satisfaction, and affect. The correlations between the two life satisfaction measures and these variables were examined to assess the construct validity of single-item life satisfaction measures. Results Consistent across three samples, single-item life satisfaction measures demonstrated substantial degree of criterion validity with the {SWLS} (zero-order r = 0.62–0.64; disattenuated r = 0.78–0.80). Patterns of statistical significance for correlations with theoretically relevant variables were the same across single-item measures and the {SWLS}. Single-item measures did not produce systematically different correlations compared to the {SWLS} (average difference = 0.001–0.005). The average absolute difference in the magnitudes of the correlations produced by single-item measures and the {SWLS} was very small (average absolute difference = 0.015–0.042). Conclusions Single-item life satisfaction measures performed very similarly compared to the multiple-item {SWLS}. Social scientists would get virtually identical answer to substantive questions regardless of which measure they use.},

The goal of the present study was to scrutinize the psychometric properties of short scales (with three items) and single-item measures for two core motivational-affective constructs (i.e., academic anxiety and academic self-concept) by conducting systematic comparisons with corresponding long scales across school subjects and within different subject domains (i.e., mathematics, German, French). Statistical analyses were based on representative data from 3879 ninth-grade students. All short forms possessed satisfactory levels of reliability (range: .75–.89) and substantial correlations with the long scales (range: .88–.97); correlational patterns with educational student characteristics (e.g., achievement, school satisfaction, gender, academic track, and socioeconomic status) were comparable to those obtained with the corresponding long scales (all average differences in correlations below .07). The correlational patterns between all single-item measures and the external criteria were similar to those obtained with the corresponding long scales (all average differences in correlations below .08), yet the single-item measures demonstrated low to modest score reliabilities (estimated with the model-based omega coefficient; range: .22–.72) and correlations with full scales (range: .50–.88).

	abstract = {While shorter instruments are more limited than longer measures, they have obvious benefits for both research and policy in terms of reduced burden and costs, and ease of interpretation.

A frequently asked question by clinical investigators is why they should use a lengthy, multi-item measurement scale to assess patients’ perceptions of their health, or quality of life, when there is evidence that a measure containing a single, global question is likely to suffice. Researchers may not wish to use lengthy scales because their core questionnaires are already long, the patient group of interest is ill or frail, they wish to minimise the burden on the patient and on the research team, or they simply want a “snap shot” of a topic rather than comprehensive coverage. In such circumstances, single questions have the obvious advantage of brevity, of making fewer demands than multi-item measures on respondents and researchers. Single, global questions have long been used in population surveys to measure health status, quality of life ({QoL}), and health related quality of life ({HRQoL}). The two most popular single global health items are self rated health status and self reported limiting, longstanding illness.

The classic self rated health status item consists of asking respondents to rate their health as “excellent, good, fair, or poor”. Variations of this question have been used in surveys worldwide. Literature reviews on the conceptualisation and measurement of health published by Rand in the {USA}1,2 and an overview by Stewart and Ware3 reported citations of the self rated health item as early as early as the 1950s. For example, a version appeared in a {US} study of occupational retirement4 and in the {US} Federal Civil Defense Administration Survey, both in the 1950s.5 And a question asking people to rate their general health, followed …},
